*All the other characters had a bit of a backtstory here, you don't get to know his either*. All you get to know is that he's in this for himself and that he's highly motivated by revenge.

## Motivation
* He is ***widly*** driven to acquire the Infernal Register.
* He has more power than access to capital/gold.
* He has a great hatred of the Cassalanters.
* He feels alone and **always will** - he is incapable of bonding with others.
