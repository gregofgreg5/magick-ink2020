# Orus 
*or whatever his name was originally*

* Orus is an orc.
* He was a warrior-shaman and was the first lieutenant, driving to one day rise to challenge for the title of *warlord* of the tribe.
* A fierce and ruthless fighter, he was betrayed by his warlord (*really not surprisingly*). He was meant to be killed, but escaped, travelling down from the North territory/mountains.
* He initially worked as muscle, learning the ways of civilization. He became a sought-out thug, and as his reputation grew he became more comfortable taking more challenging and lucrative jobs.
* Frequently hires out to the Zhentarim, usually as muscle.
* Not affiliated with the current, *up & coming* movement of the Zhents.
* Currently working for **someone else**, hired by Hansel Orethax to try to acquire the Infernal Register.
* He has been assigned to undertake any means necessary to get it and has been told that he can be given a bankroll of gold to purchase the Register, if he can a) verify that it's legit; b) verify that he's not just going to abscond with the loot.
