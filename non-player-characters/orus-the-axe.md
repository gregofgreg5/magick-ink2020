*or whatever his name was originally*

* Orus is an orc.
* He was a warrior-shaman and was the first lieutenant, driving to one day rise to challenge for the title of *warlord* of the tribe.
* A fierce and ruthless fighter, he was betrayed by his warlord (*really not surprisingly*). He was meant to be killed, but escaped, travelling down from the North territory/mountains.
* He draws his sorcerous magic from an ancient, primal, force that is embodied by rage, violence and lust.
* He initially worked as muscle, learning the ways of civilization. He became a sought-out thug, and as his reputation grew he became more comfortable taking more challenging and lucrative jobs.
* Frequently hires out to the Zhentarim, usually as muscle.
* Not affiliated with Manshoon's cadre of the Zhents.
* Currently working for **someone else**, hired by Hansel Orethax to try to acquire the Infernal Register.
* He has been assigned to undertake any means necessary to get it and has been told that he can be given a bankroll of gold to purchase the Register, if he can a) verify that it's legit; b) verify that he's not just going to abscond with the loot.

Motivation
He works for a lot of money, but he's doesn't do it for the money. He takes the money to get the adventures, for the thrill of it, for bloodllust. 
He has a sense of loyalty to his word, when he takes a job he gives an oath to complete the mission.
He no longer has any ambition to become part of any larger organization or take a leadership role, he respects the power of groups (like the Zhent), he likes the idea of working for Orethax and the people he represents. He sees them as an opportunity for more missions.
