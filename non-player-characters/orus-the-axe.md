# Orus 
*or whatever his name was originally*
* Orus is an orc.
* He was a warrior-shaman and was the first lieutenant, driving to one day rise to challenge for the title of *warlord* of the tribe.
* A fierce and ruthless fighter, he was betrayed by his warlord (*really not surprisingly*). He was meant to be killed, but escaped, travelling down from the North territory/mountains.
He initially worked as muscle, learning the ways of civilization. He became a sought-out thug, and as his reputation grew he became more comfortable taking more challenging and lucrative jobs.
