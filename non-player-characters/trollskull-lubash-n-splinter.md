# Trollskull Manor
## While you were away: Lubash & Splinter

The Harpers showed up every morning and were enough of a discouraging presence to disuade the Zhents from causing any trouble most days, the evenings were another story. The Tavern at Trollskull Manor, or *The Tavern* as it was becoming known, had quickly become one of the most sought out ports of call in Waterdeep. For the most part Emmett and whatever random Harper or Watch or Chella, if he and his ilk were around, could keep trouble to a minimum. But a few nights after the Tavernlords left to sea, the Xanathar paid another visit. This time, they started a small brawl. 

There was no fire bomb or orge bomb this time, but without the Tavernlords there to keep the peace, it was a mess. The next morning, After receiving the report from the night before Captain Guryon visited Emmett. He let Emmett know that the Tavernlords were on *shaky ground* and that they were wanted for questioning in connection to the sinking of *Eyecatcher*. Of course Emmett had heard about the lost ship, it was the talk of the town. And he knew that the Tavernlords had gone to the docks that night. And those seemed like remarkable coincidences, especially for these particular *tavernlords*. But they are his Tavernlords. And to some extent, Guryon's as well. Guryon tells him that there isn't much he can do as a Watch Captain, but he's spoken with some friends and arranged for them to bring by some folk for him to interview.

A few hours later, Volo showed up with a half a dozen bruisers and ruffians to interview. Powerful, menancing, some even magical, they all had their own gimmick and were all a little rough around the edges. Still he knew that he needed some muscle, some force arond the tavern, to keep the peace when the lords were around... until they came back. Barakka would bring them back, he was sure of it. He also had the feeling that these were the left overs from the Yawning Portal's brute squad. 

Emmett was sure of one thing, The Tavern didn't need the Yawning Portal's cast offs. *At least he hoped that they wouldn't*.

He hadn't exactly given up hope, who knew what tomorrow would bring, his Da always used to say. And maybe the Tavernlords would be back. Though given the trouble at the docks, he was pretty sure that if they were going to come back quickly, they would be back by now. They were either in the middle of it, or well...

Before he could finish the thought, Floon Blagmaar strolled in with two of the most unorthodox looking... *creatures* in tow. Emmett smiled briefly, an experienced leader of men, knowing that he had found his troop, and then quickly slipped into his game face "For goodness sakes Floon? Is that a freaking troll?!?"

"Did you hear what he called you Splinters? We ain't gonna take that from no old coot." The troll said, turning to his wooden companion.

"Ooh," Emmett nodded to Floon, "I like them."

And after a brief interview, it was agreed that Lubash, the troll and his partner Splinters would hire on for a month, to see how it went.
