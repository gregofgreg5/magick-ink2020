## Plot Hooks
 
**Short term goals:** *(current motivation)* On a day-to-day basis he is under the employ of the Xanathar. He does not consider himself a mercinary, rather more identifies as a commander of sorts, reporting to Xanathar's upper leadership eschelon, if not the Xanathar itself. He enjoys the *comfort and security* of being a *key* part of the organization, something that he has constantly sought out since leaving Llurth Dreier. He is not the kind of leader who *makes the big plan*, rather he would rather develop a plan and carry it out with an action squad. Scheming is not his strong suit.

**Long term goals:** *(what do you want to be when you grow up?)* 

**Plots You Would Like to See Your Character Experience:** *(where do we go from here?)* *Well, he's dead*
If he hadn't gotten killed, it might have been cool to see him embroiled in some dispute with his sister: with an adventuring party caught in between.
An adventure in which he and the Crimson Sail either crosspaths or are in league might have been on the horizon.
 
**Tell your story:** *(history)* When his mother's enclave was decimated in a brutal battle with a number of factions, including the Llurth Dreir army, he escaped the underdark and made for the surface. He believed at the time to be the last survivor of the enclave, until he discovered that one of his sibilings (Dor Ralla' Shiel) had also managed to escape. Initially he hid in a number of Drow communities, aping their culture or religion to fit in, while remaining fairly devout to his mother's teachings of Ghaunadaur. he found that he had a knack for leadership, especially with soldiers, thugs and the more physical sort.

Following the training that his mother had begun, during his travels, he sought out training in dark magicks (usually Drow). While his skils never grew to rival those of his mother (or sister for that matter), he was still a competant warlock.

After spending about a decade traveling, he eventually made his way to Waterdeep where he set down roots. He became a member of the City Watch, rising to the rank of Captain and was a valued member of the Bregan D'aerthe guild. His fifty-year career came to an abrupt halt when he was outed as one of the leaders of an emerging criminal organization involved in the assassination of a Masked Lord. His own popularity and the general displeasure withe murdered Masked Lord, saved him from execution, but he was drummed out of the Watch, Force Grey and excommunicated from Bregan D'aerthe. Though, he still maintained candelestine relations with many of the Bregan D'aerthe guild leadership throughout the years.

It was a continued testament to his good favor in the city that he did not flee, but instead became a mercinary, eventually finding his way into the service of the Xanathar.

**Preferred weapon:** Early in his travels he dispatched the wizard Hrexon and adopted the wizard's prize weapons, the ***Sinster knives***: *osprey, the hand, viper, and edge*, as his own. He is also a marksman with a hand crossbow and specialized with a short sword.
