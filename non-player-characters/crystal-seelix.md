*Se-al’ah*

Se-al’ah was a high born of the Silver Kingdom (translated), she was the Second Daughter, “the Shield of Mana” whose job it was to lead the Kingdom’s forces against all enemies. A trained combatant, her true power came from her magic. Se-al’ah had a powerful connection to her patron, who like many of these creatures were never named to anyone outside of the Silver Kingdom and were seldom even discussed or identified with anyone – anyone at all. Those who had the connections were obvious, their powers were manifest. But it was a personal gift that often came with personal missions, that always seemed to serve the patron and in turn, the Silver Kingdom. As such, these sorcerers kept to their own, often never knowing if others served the same patron. Some sorcerers may have suspected that their patron had other identities, maybe was known to others as some other being, but it was never relevant or openly explored.

Se-al’ah was still a novice, bereft of any true fighting experience, under the tutelage of _the Regent Shield_ when the Lost Cataclysm erupted. Her patron, like so many others in the land, found themselves separated from many of their vessels, but unlike most others (the patron’s) immersion in the multiverse allowed some of their vessels to hold on to a shadow of their powers, at least temporarily. Other vessels (of the patron), like Se-al’ah were pulled into the multiverse, only to find their bodies and spirits completely destroyed or thrown into another plane.

It was in this manner, that Se-al’ah found herself, 130 years old, barely an adult, on her own, in Faerun. She had lost almost everything that he had and knew, lost in this strange new world. To her comfort, she found that at least, she still had (patron) and their power ran furiously through her, one of their few remaining vessels.

She has known many names since then, long abandoning “Se-al’ah”. And in these guises, she developed into a powerful sorcerer and found a life-long alliance with the Xanathar guild, even serving through the transition from one “Xanathar” to another three times. Her dedication to the guild, to the Xanathar replaced the blood-born and sworn loyalties that she had for her family and the Silver Kingdom. 

* She's an elf.
* She's been here for 70 years.
* She is after the Infernal Register for the Xanathar.
* She is fiercely loyal to the Guild, one of the *top agents* of the guild, she has been in her role longer than anyone - than even the current Xanathar. She thinks of herself as the power/leadership of the guild.


## Motivation
She is after the Register for the Guild.
The Guild has been in piched turf war with the Zhentarim for the past few years. The Zhent seem to be growing and growing while their numbers dwindle.
She believes that with the Register, ***she*** can help the Xanathar turn the tide.
