*Se-al’ah*

Se-al’ah was a high born of the Silver Kingdom (translated), she was the Second Daughter, “the Shield of Mana” whose job it was to lead the Kingdom’s forces against all enemies. A trained combatant, her true power came from her magic. Se-al’ah had a powerful connection to her patron, who like many of these creatures were never named to anyone outside of the Silver Kingdom and were seldom even discussed or identified with anyone – anyone at all. Those who had the connections were obvious, their powers were manifest. But it was a personal gift that often came with personal missions, that always seemed to serve the patron and in turn, the Silver Kingdom. As such, these sorcerers kept to their own, often never knowing if others served the same patron. Some sorcerers may have suspected that their patron had other identities, maybe was known to others as some other being, but it was never relevant or openly explored.

Se-al’ah was still a novice, bereft of any true fighting experience, under the tutelage of a (Regent Shield) when the Lost Cataclysm erupted. Her patron, like so many others in the land, found themselves separated from many of their vessels, but unlike most others (the patron’s) immersion in the multiverse allowed some of their vessels to hold on to a shadow of their powers, at least temporarily. Other vessels (of the patron), like Se-al’ah were pulled into the multiverse, only to find their bodies and spirits completely destroyed or thrown into another plane.

It was in this manner, that Se-al’ah found herself, 130 years old, barely an adult, on her own, in Faerun. She had lost almost everything that he had and knew, lost in this strange new world. To her comfort, she found that at least, she still had (patron) and their power ran furiously through her, one of their few remaining vessels.

She has known many names since then, long abandoning “Se-al’ah”. And in these guises, she developed into a powerful sorcerer and found a life-long alliance with the Xanathar guild, even serving through the transition from one “Xanathar” to another three times. Her dedication to the guild, to the Xanathar replaced the blood-born and sworn loyalties that she had for her family and the Silver Kingdom. 





* Orus is an orc.
* He was a warrior-shaman and was the first lieutenant, driving to one day rise to challenge for the title of *warlord* of the tribe.
* A fierce and ruthless fighter, he was betrayed by his warlord (*really not surprisingly*). He was meant to be killed, but escaped, travelling down from the North territory/mountains.
* He draws his sorcerous magic from an ancient, primal, force that is embodied by rage, violence and lust.
* He initially worked as muscle, learning the ways of civilization. He became a sought-out thug, and as his reputation grew he became more comfortable taking more challenging and lucrative jobs.
* Frequently hires out to the Zhentarim, usually as muscle.
* Not affiliated with Manshoon's cadre of the Zhents.
* Currently working for **someone else**, hired by Hansel Orethax to try to acquire the Infernal Register.
* He has been assigned to undertake any means necessary to get it and has been told that he can be given a bankroll of gold to purchase the Register, if he can a) verify that it's legit; b) verify that he's not just going to abscond with the loot.

## Motivation
He works for a lot of money, but he's doesn't do it for the money. He takes the money to get the adventures, for the thrill of it, for bloodllust. 
He has a sense of loyalty to his word, when he takes a job he gives an oath to complete the mission.
He no longer has any ambition to become part of any larger organization or take a leadership role, he respects the power of groups (like the Zhent), he likes the idea of working for Orethax and the people he represents. He sees them as an opportunity for more missions.
