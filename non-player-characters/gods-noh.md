# Noh, The Two-In-One God

These two gods - whose original names have been lost to time - were in love with one another and desperate to be together. But fate, circumstance, and the machinations of other dieties constantly kept them apart. One summer they decided to use all of their power to finally come together, but the spell worked a little too well. The gods now inhabit a single space, sharing thoughts and feelings but never allowed to touch. They renamed themselves the singular "Noh" and took their place among the upper eschelons of the pantheon. When they appear, they constantly shift from one to the other, only pausing as a single entity when one is speaking before resuming their eternal dance.

## Noh|Justice

A muscular woman with dark, braided hair and chocolate skin. Projects the feeling of inevitability. Carries an adamantine halberd.

## Noh|Peace

A slender man with white hair, darkly tanned skin and a warm glow that radiates from every atom. Seems fragile yet projects quiet confidence. Carries a golden shepherd's crook.
