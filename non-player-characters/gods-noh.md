# Noh, The Two-In-One God

These two gods - whose original names have been lost to time - were in love with one another and desperate to be together. But fate, circumstance, and the machinations of other dieties (the domains of trickery, greed, and war) constantly kept them apart. One summer they decided to use all of their power to finally come together, but the spell worked a little too well. The gods now inhabit a single space, sharing thoughts and feelings but never allowed to touch. A powerful elder god took pity on them and tried to separate them, but determined that they can no longer exist separately and any attempt to pull them apart would destroy them both. They renamed themselves the singular "Noh" and took their place among the upper eschelons of the pantheon.

When they appear, Noh constantly shifts from one aspect to the other, only pausing as a single entity when one speaks for themself or from their particular authority. During those moments, the other appears behind the speaker, back-to-back.  

## Noh|Justice

A muscular woman with dark, braided hair and chocolate skin. Projects the feeling of inevitability. Wears a breastplate and mail, and carries an adamantine glaive with blades on both ends. Noh|Justice is the patron of law and is invoked before trials, trade disputes, treaty negotiations, and for solving personal grievances. A statue of Noh with her arms outstretched and her glaive balanced in her hands is sometimes placed in between negotiating parties. Should the glaive fall to one side or the other, it's seen as the god supporting that claimant's position. Noh should not be confused with the god of vengeance.

## Noh|Peace

A slender man with white hair, wide avian eyes, darkly tanned skin and a warm glow that radiates from every atom. Seems fragile yet projects quiet confidence. Wears light-colored silks and linens (shirtless) and carries a golden shepherd's crook. Noh|Peace is most commonly invoked for blessings in greetings and farewells. He is also called on to oversee treaty negotiations and war councils (if any attempt might be made to avoid war). Though technically not a god of death, his invocation is infrequently used at the end of life, usually when somone has been sick or in pain and seeks release.

*OP NOTE: Noh is the perfect diety for an in-game Jedi, dedicated to peace but able to execute justice. Because of Noh's duality and broad spectrum of domain, use of their name has become as common and varied as "aloha."
