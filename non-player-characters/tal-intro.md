# Tal
*Adept from the Westgate Academy of the Diegesis*

* Tal is a 279 year old elf. 
* She is an adept from the Diegesis Academy in Westgate. 
* She had *recently* been studying under an adept adventurer, Einrich.
* While exploring the Temple of Ramenos they discovered a series of symbols that Einrich thought were *new* and not from this plane.
* These symbols were shiny, translucent and colorful. They appeared to be painted, not carved into the ruins and only appeared in the presence of a small orb that they had discovered in the Mere earlier in the year.
* The towers themselves were still under the Mere, but on the surrounding ruins, they found the symbols.
* While they investigating the Illefarn ruins, something happened... her eyes filled with an explosion of color and a terrible cacophony of sound, like a dozen bards playing different instruments being smashed into a small pieces all playing their instruments badly. And then she blacked out.
* When she awoke she was surrounded by Bullywugs and Yuan-ti. She was able to defeat a handful of them before she was subdued by creatures that she surmised were actually batrachi. Unbelievably, batrachi, who had not been seen on this plane for eons.
* She was taken prisoner and interorgated. As is the way of the Diegesis, she shared the things that they had learned that weren't derived in secret.
* Tal could not say whether or not they believed her, but she was placed in this cell, about five days ago.
* She is an extremely competent combatant. She is an expert swordsperson and a master at unarmed combat.
