**Tell your story:** 
In a far away land TBD, in the realm of the artificers, there is a mountain home of Gnomercy.  Here the gnomes join the dwarves and other races that masters of tool and ore to make their wonderous inventions and weapons of dread.

Gunmetal has a habit having his mouth write a check his ass can't cash.  Since he's good at his work and is actually kinda smart, he usually gets himself out of trouble.  

Before he was known as Gunmetal, he was Gattlack Bronzebender.  Gattlack's father was an artificer that made battle weapons.  Gattlack's mom was an artificer too and usually repurposed dad’s inventions for safer use around the home and children.

Gattlack’s father died from an invention gone wrong.  He was seen as a hero, sacrificing his body to save the other artificer’s and to make sure the invention got destroyed.  After this event, Gattlack gained several adopted “uncles” that helped Gattlack get into the family business.

After Gattlack was accepted as an apprentice, his mom took her own life.  She had been holding her grief and guilt until Gattlack came of age and was set on his path.  Once he was in the guild, she ended her pain the only way she could see how.

Gattlack carried on the family tradition, but this is when he began to develop his mouth.  He was clearly gifted and smart, but his mouth needed some more editing.
When Gattlack was nearing the end of time as a journeyman and was ready to be promoted to a full-fledged, guild back artificer, Gattlack met and flirted with an heiress of a rich ruling family of Gnomercy.  Her other, presumably more “worthy” suitors took notice and were even more worked up when the heiress was clearly enamored with Gattlack for his confidence and clear ability.

The rival suitors conspired against Gattlack and began to sabotage his work and started rumors.  Unprepared to handle this kind of adversity, Gattlack planted a trap invention intended to hurt the ringleader of the suitors.  Everything went tragically wrong and instead crippled and disfigured the heiress.

There wasn’t hard evidence to connect Gattlack to the incident, but it wasn’t hard to connect the dots.  Before more could happen to Gattlack, his uncles arranged his exile from Gnomercy and told Gattlack of the Warforged Artificer that traveled to another world to start the profession artificer there.  With instructions in hand and his escape made, Gattlack left the name of Bronzebender behind to become Gunmetal Grey (his favorite paint).  

Gunmetal made his way to the crossing point to the other world mostly uneventfully.  Things turned south once he crossed over and appeared right in front a band of slavers.  He was captured by the slavers and they began making there way to their slaver port.  During the journey, Gunmetal toughened up to survive and secretly worked on the masterpiece father and uncles handed down, the Steel Defender (aka Robo-doggo).  

Gunmetal freed himself, but was now in the middle of the sea with his robo-doggo.  After being adrift for a day, he was rescued by the Crimson Sail.  They nursed him back to health and was amazed by his story.  They agreed to take him to Waterdeep.

Once in Waterdeep, Gunmetal made his way to the House of Inspired Hands and met the Warforged Artificer (WFA).  After hearing Gunmetal’s story, the WFA said that for his past transgressions, he could not stay at the House of Inspired Hands.  The WFA did give Gunmetal a blank journal, a book on the history of artifact making and set Gunmetal up in a shop in an OK-ish part of town.  If after time, if Gunmetal proves himself beyond his past follies, more help could be granted from the WFA.

Once set up in his new shop, Gunmetal started making improvements to Robo-Doggo and made himself an asset to his new community.  To keep his tools from constantly getting stolen, he and Robo-Doggo started to take on some of the more aggressive criminal element in his area with success.  This got the attention of the City Guard and eventually turned into membership of Force Grey.

He is determined to make himself a new future to atone for his past.  He clearly has his father’s ability for making weapons, but is tempered by the memory of his mother’s kindness and humbled by his exile.  But sometimes – sometimes – that mouth still needs help with editing.


**Preferred weapon:**  It was his greeat axe and returning hand axe, but now he has this arrowless bow...
