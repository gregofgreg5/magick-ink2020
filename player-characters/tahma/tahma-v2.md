## Option #1: The Feat Style
### AC: 17
No armor, no shield, +4 dex, +3 wis
***Fighting style  & one rare item replaced by Homebrew feat:**

[Unarmored Defense Expert](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Unarmored_Defense_Expert_(5e_Feat))
> _Prerequisites: Dexterity score of 13 or higher._
> You have trained to fight unarmored. Choose one ability score of the following: Constitution, Wisdom or Charisma. You gain the following benefits:
> 
> Increase the chosen ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
> While you aren't wearing armor or using a shield, you can calculate your AC as 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your chosen ability score modifier.

## Weapon
Replace both scimitars with:
[Wardancer's spear](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/comments/mu2m5j/the_griffons_saddlebag_wardancers_spear_weapon/)
> **Wardancer's Spear**
> _Weapon (spear), rare_
> 
> This double-bladed spear is extraordinarily light and perfectly balanced for use with one hand. While holding this magic spear with one hand, it has the finesse property. Whenever you take the Attack action and make a melee attack with the spear using only one hand, you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with the spear. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
>
> Immediately after you use your bonus action in this way, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, though you can't move farther than your remaining movement would allow.
It doesn't say it, but I think it should be +1, like the scmitars were. With a +1 bonus would be:
+8 to hit (1d6+5), bonus attac: +8 to hit (1d6) - but  would only use the bonus when they're not moving/attacking their spirit.

## Option #2: Shielded
### AC: 17
No armor (AC 10) + Dex (+4) +2 shield (no magical bonus) + 1 fighting style

## Weapon
Replace one scimitar with the **Wardancer's spear** (see above)

## Shield
Replace other scimitar with **Recoil shield**

>
> This gnomish tinker shield has a spring-loaded plate on the front that can be used to knock a foe flat. This shield has 3 charges and regains 1 charge at dawn. While wielding this shield when a creature misses with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to expend and force the creature to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, their attack recoils off the spring loaded front of the shield and knocks them prone.

## Fighting Style
Switch Two weapon fighting for ***Defensive***
> While you are wearing armor you get a +1 bonus to AC.
*Shields apparently count as **armor**.*

## Option #3: Ted comes up with something!!!
I'm less interested in the shiled idea, only because I don't like shields in general. Specifically, I don't really like it for the classes/character build, just one more thing to have to hide when they're trying to shapechange themselves into someone else! But I'm not completely opposed to it.

I moved away from the scimitar, for no real reason other than *why a scimitar*...? 

I searched around for a different finesse weapon. I came up with a sickle and a this spear. I liked the spear better. I imagine them using it like the Dora Milajae from the Black Panter use their spears! But I'm not married to that either. Though, what I did like about the spear is it lets them escape a little, for when they don't have their spirit around to teleport. It wouldn't let them get out of melee range, but would at least move them away.
