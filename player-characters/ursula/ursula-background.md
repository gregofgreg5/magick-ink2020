**Tell your story:** *(history)* A blacksmith and soldier in the Fey military, Ursula is no stranger to life and death struggles, the tedium of war, and the need for strong bonds of friendship within fighting teams. At some point during one of the many battles between the various races within the Feywild, Ursula was assigned protective duty over a minor dignitary. However, she saw that the battle was going poorly and a beloved comrade was in danger. Feeling that the dignitary would be safe so far from the fighting, she ran to aid her comrade and saved them from almost certain death. It was at that point that the assassins, hiding in the shadows and waiting for just such an opportunity, attacked and killed the dignitary. The Archfey was furious with Ursula and bound her to service until the life-debt could be repaid.

Because Jarik was so easily incapacitated during his first adventure, his Fey Patron has decided that he needs help. To help repay her debt to this same Fey, Ursula has been assigned to Jarik as his "familiar." Her ability to protect others (EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE SHE LET DIE) as well as her lifebond to Jarik should help him survive and serve his Patron better. There will be some kind of retribution if Jarik dies on Ursula's watch.

**Preferred weapon:** Halberd (Guisarme-Voulge)
