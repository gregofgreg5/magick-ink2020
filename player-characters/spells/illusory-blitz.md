The creature/target must succeed on a Wisdom DC v your Charisma+prof level or take 1d10 psychic damage. The resulting wound seems real and proportionate to the effect you chose. On a successful DC, the target realizes the attack is an illusion. The Illusory Blast becomes faint and the target and is harmless. If this spell reduces a creatures hit points to 0, the creature is stable but Unconscious until it regains HP.<br>Illusory effects produced by this spell (excluding any damage dealt) disappear at the beginning of your next turn.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
