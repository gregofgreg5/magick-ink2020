**Base of operations:** He has a room at the monastary, which he considers home. He also maintains a bunk wherever he can afford in Neverwinter, depending on the work he can get. When possible, he prefers to take work that also provides room & board. The closer he can get to others, the more information he can collect.

## Plot Hooks

As is the way of the order, he is willing to trade information.

**Tell your story:** His training as a brother has put him on a lifelong quest for knowledge and information about the world and the people in it. *Secrets, they like secrets.* 

He was found by the monastery as toddler and raised as an adept. *Blending in, fitting in and establishing relationships that allow the brothers to dig into deep wells of information* are hallmarks of this order. His particular... well, *species* allowed him to be trained in a more *aggressive* manner than most of the order. While many of his brothers are trained to be advisers or viziers or accountants or surveyors, he has been trained to be a brute, a hired hand or mercenary. Like all brothers of the order, he is being groomed in the way of the shadow, in order to both protect the monastery, but also to assist in gathering information. For many of his brothers this training is hidden, something that they use in secret to learn more in whatever cover that they are operating within. For brothers like Vasari, these skills often become part of their *marketable package*.


**Preferred weapon:** *TBD*
