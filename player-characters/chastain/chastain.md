  * Echo gains a HD every once in awhile. In game terms the effect will be to allow the *echo* to take a hit (or two) before being disappated and having to be recalled. Character-wise, his connection to his echoes is growing stronger, in a more unique way than most Echo Knights' leveling because of his backstory.

**Tell your story:** *(history)*

Chastain was a Knight Sergeant in the ranks of the Kryn’s Aurora Watch. A fierce, brave and good-hearted warrior, who was renowned for his leadership and compassion. But few knew that he hid a dark secret: when Chastain slept, he dreamed that he was the echo, assisting another him in other times and places, seeing the world and all it beauty and horrors. But, he thought, these were just dreams. 

One night he dreamt of a battle. The other him switched places with the echo just as a magical explosion ripped through them both. 

Startled awake, Chastain found that he was now that other version of him in a far off land, with surroundings and comrades he barely knew. So far he's been able to convince them that everything is fine. But some are starting to suspect that something's off.
