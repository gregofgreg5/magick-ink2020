_* = usually "actions"_





*Can use Feline Agility or Steady Aim each turn, not both! (Because of movement)*
## Combat - once per turn
**Sneak attack allows her to deal an extra 1d6 (/turn), if you have advantage (which you can get as a bonus action using Feline Agility) or if there is another enemy within 5' of your target!**

### Feline Agility (Use this with Disengage or Dash)
When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
Move: 30x2= 60' (Dash: 120!) Climb: 20x2=40 

### Steady Aim (Bonus Action)
Give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
***Don't use if you have two enemies within 5ft of each other***

### and Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
*You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

**Actions**
#### Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on Your Turn if you dash.
Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

#### Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your Movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for Hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section.

**Telekinetic (Feat)**
You learn to move things with your mind, granting you the following benefits:
**Ability Score Improvement** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**You learn the [Mage Hand cantrip](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand)**. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible. If you already know this spell, its range increases by 30 feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

#### Telekinetic Shove
As a **bonus action**, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.
