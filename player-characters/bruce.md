**Preferred weapon:** *Bruce* is training in the art of the ninja, in the Brotherhood of the Red Knight, where he is mastering the art of two-sword combat. Traditionally the weapons of this craft are a ninjato (straight, single-edged short sword). In order to be less conspicuous, the Order of the Red Knight have taken to training with a variety of short swords, and use them in the same fashion as they would a ninjato. He carries two inornate short swords and wears a small knife (dagger) concealed and secured to his back, with hilt facing down. The Order also trains in the use of small edged, throwing weapons, similar to darts.
