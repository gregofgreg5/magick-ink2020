# Waterdeep circa -750DR part 01

## *Orcs are big too? WTF.* 	
### Orc Hunt (February 10, 2021)

### Preface
>A band of orcs had been raiding the outskirts or *easy targets* around **Tyr's Burden**. The raids started in the farms and area in the north east and have moved down south and back up again. The raids have occured about once a month. Usually about a dozen orcs come through and are easily fended off by the constable,  his deputies and (a lot of) brave citizens. *Folk in Tyr's Burden aren't anyone's victims!*


Tyr's Burden was a very small hamlet that was founded by a handful of pioneers looking to start anew on the brave frontier. With dreams of creating a farming community, to do Tyr's work, they moved west. The founders of Tyr's Burden came from the outskirts of a town called ***Morinden***, which had become increasingly oppressive over the past few years. The lord of Morinden had steadily increased taxes on their produce and had even begun to tax the church. 

Less than a day's walk to the ocean and two days to Waterdeep Mountain by way of the Long Road, Tyr's Burden was established just over a decade ago and it has indeed become a small, thriving farming community. Farming produce and artisan crafts were the mainstay of Tyr's Burden at this time, though there were those beginning to explore fishing enterprises.

Tyr's Burden was governed by a Civic Council. The council was traditionally made up of a mayor, curate (religious leader), constable, and at least one arcane specialist. 

**Mayor Tyson Harper** was also the leader of the caravan of pioneers who headed west out of Morinden. Back in Morinden he was a deputy for the sheriff whose job it was to police the outskirts of the rapidly growing metropolis. He is the twin brother of Maurice Harper and lifelong friend of Horace Stratford. In fact, thought Maurice will not ever talk about it, in their youths the three of them were part of a semi-celebrated adventuring party that operated out of Morinden. He *retired* to the sheriffs.

**Curate Maurice Harper** always wanted to be a priest, a cleric of Tyr. He entered seminary as soon as he could and found that as an acolyte he was sent out to the world to spread the word of Tyr and gain experience, a period of his life that he never talks about. Once he *retired* from that life, he was able to take more active role in the church, where he excelled and quickly became one of the most sought out brothers in the order. Performing ministry to the rural outskirts that his brother served as deputy, he is credited to leave 

**Constable* Horace Stratford** was also a sheriff's deupty back in Morinden. He liked the idea of being a lawman, but didn’t do so well with taking orders. He didn’t last very long as a deputy. And afterwards, he found himself between careers, as much as on any path, until they headed west. He wasn't sure that he wanted this job at first. But he had known Tyson (the Mayor) and Maurice (Curate of Tyr) since they were all kids. So when Tyson, who had stood as his second when he married Felicia and vis-versa, was adamant about this little project, he figured he had to go and he may as well have a job. They don't talk about it very often, but the three of them: Horace, Maurice and Tyson were adventurers, *explorers* in their own right when they were younger. In fact, the other two never talk about those days, but if you try hard enough you might get a story out of Horace. As the Constable, he is fair, though there really hasn't been a lot of trouble in the hamlet.

*Enchanter* Charmane, sorcerer and Tyna Wildheart, the *Archdruid* round out the Civic Council.

It didn't take long for the people of Tyr's Burden to embrace the strangers. At first they thought the Force Grey task force was a traveling minstrel show. Mayor Tyson and the Constable knew better, almost immediately. *Like, as they say, recognized like* and they were thrilled to see these clearly able adventurers. Exactly what they needed for this orc problem. And, again they knew *lost souls* when they see them.

For Force Grey, it seemed like a good trade while they figured out where they were. When they were. And how they were going to get home. In exchange for room and board, they agreed to help defend the hamlet from the orcs.

Force Grey learned that it had been about three and half weeks since the orcs last attack. They attacked irregulalry, but about a month a part. The Constable thought that they were coming from the north, so they set Force Grey up in tents on the northern outskirts. 

Tyr's Burden's Constable had five deputies. Constable Stratford didn't like it, but it was said that his five deputies were the young men who weren't any good at farming and worse at everything else. As far as he was concerned, they did their best, and were more than capable for most of Tyr's Burden's needs. Still, acknowledging this, the Constable was very happy for Force Grey's help fortifying the hamlet's defenses.

Manny and Grosh worked on training and arming the deputies and as many of the townfolk as possible. Gunmetal Grey assisted building up fortifications. Meanwhile, Talib was making friends with Curate Harper, the jury was still out on who was trying to convert whom. Or if either made any headway. But both would agree mutual respect was earned.

Gunmetal also made acquaintances with Daerin Stonebottom, one of the few dwarves who left Melairbode to live in Tyr's Burden. Stonebottom owned and operated one of the two dwarven workshops in the hamlet. The other was run by the Longbeard family and was in operation around the clock. Steelbottom on the other hand was a little eccentric and preferred to keep to himself. He had a few good friends in the hamlet, Tyna Wyldheart and the Constable to name two.

Stonebottom had a long lasting fascination with artificers. He met one once who was passing through Melairbode, about a hundreds of years ago, when he was just a kid. He was ecstatic to get to spend time with Gunmetal and watch him work. And get to know more about Doggo.

One morning, towards the end of the week, ***Leopold Fazzanach***, an eccentric, young halfling wizard begged the party's favor. On the most recent raid the orcs stole a staff that he had been working on. He tells them that it was important to his work, if they could return it to him, he would be **so grateful.**

When pressed, the wizard explained that the staff had no real power, yet. He was working off of an ancient spell lore that he had discovered and was preparing the staff to be enchanted. This process intrigued Gunmetal, sounding to him like maybe some long-forgotten arcane version of his own sects imbue practice. 

Force Grey could see the man's desperation and they judged him to be trustworthy, so they agreed to look for and return the staff if they found it. Very excited, he drew them quick sketch of the *approximately three-foot long staff*.

### Except that's north west

After all was said and done, they waited over a week before they saw any action. They set up Doggo to work a perimeter and volunteers from the deputies and town folk stayed up to sound the alarm. 

The orc raiding party came from the north, but went behind the low hills to the east to the farms on the South East. There were a dozen orcs and they had brought a wagon drawn by two horses.

Talib unleashed his flaming mace.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mhLlK8o.jpg)
The head of the mace burst into flames! The tiefling and his fiery weapon cut a terrifying image in the pasture, swinging (and unfortunately missing) at the lumbering orc menace. However, Talib found that his aim with his [spectral weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon) spell was on-track and deadly. Manny took the the orcs with his bracer of of blades and his devastating dagger work. Meanwhile, Gunmetal found his new bow, a gift from Daerin Stonebottom, a little more tricky than it was in practice and Doggo had an even worse time. A novelty, drawing the attention of the orcs, the mechanical canine was knocked down, quickly trussed and thrown into the wagon!

Their numbers dwindling quickly, three orcs planned to make a hasty retreat with their robotic prize. But Grosh, as expected, had been excelling in the melee and saw the wagon about to depart. Fearlessly, the mighty minotaur clad in his gorgeous plate armor, lowered his head and charged across the field. Grosh hit the wagon square with a horn and his broad, armored shoulder. He tore into the back of the wagon, crushing the left-rear wheel and the cargo bed above it. Saved, of a sort, but still bound, Doggo flopped unceremoniously to the turf!

Gunmetal, Grosh and company made quick work of the remaining orcs, intentionally allowing two of them to flee. They waited briefly and then instructed Doggo to give pursuit with the instructions to return when the orcs made camp and not to get caught! While they were inspecting the very minimal damage that the orcs were able to do to the hamlet, Doggo returned. It had only been gone for a couple hours. Gunmetal reported that the orcs had stopped for a break and then bolted straight for Doggo! Fortunately, it had enough time to realize what was happening and enough distance between them to turn (*mechanical*) tail and run!

With fresh, very clear tracks to follow, in the winter grass, the team consulted with the council of Tyr's Burden and let them know their plan to give pursuit. They outfitted the wagon and stock that they had been given by the town for the mission and Gunmetal quickly repaired the smashed wagon the orcs had left behind. With the two wagons ready to go, they team head off into the morning light.

They traveled for about a day, trading off resting and guiding the wagons, with Doggo out front following the orc's trail. Even over a day old, the trail was fairly easy to follow in the tall grass. The orcs initially headed out east, but turned sharply north, *ducking behind* the low hills skirting Tyr's Burden. 

The trail abruptly ended at a large patch of grass that was mysteriously darker than the rest of grass leasing up to it. Talib dropped a shower of [sacred flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sacred-flame) which appeared to dance along the surface of the grass and then extinguish as if the surface were damp. It did look darker, but did not look *exactly* damp. Manny stabbed at the grass and reported that it felt soft, almost spongy and found that it was difficult to pull his weapon out. Grosh, noticed that the darker grass appeared to sit on top of the lighter grass, and probed between with one of the orc's disgarded javelins. It went about a foot and then stopped, he pushed the javelin further into the flora. Gorsh and Manny used the javelin like a lever and tried to move the mysterious grass, to no avail.

It didn't take lone for Force Grey to realize that while the orc's tracks stopped at the edge of the darker surface, they continued on the other side. Deciding, whatever the dark grass was, had to be a mystery for another day, they continued to follow the orcs tracks...

**To be Continued...
February 24, 2021!**

## Who would name a place *Squalor*?
February 24, 2021

### We might need those wagons later
*It's like you guys are collecting wagons* I get it, mix in more treasure.

After careful scrutiny, Force Grey decided to leave the creature, *whatever it was* behind and carry on following the orc tracks. The trail went on winding through the hills and low lands until it led to the top of the hills.

Below, they could see the base of what was clearly once a great tower surrounded by the rancid squalidness of the orc tribe. Refuse and broken parts of various plundered items lay strewn all about he area around the ruins. Four wolves were feasting on a handful of various carcasses. They could see two more wagons, one tethered to a horse and another sitting beside it. They could hear horses on the other side of the tower. Walking around the site were three orcs.

Gunmetal Grey was almost giddy with excitement. Along the journey he had plotted and planned, schemed even. One by one, with each team member,he went over the plan, *the war wagon*. Looking down, the incline made it even better than he had ever imagined.

Quickly, Gunmetal instructed Grosh to break down parts of the wagon while he and Talib would mend it back together in a new, more nefarious form. The mundane, innocent wagon that first went down this road a few days ago with the orcs, was transformed into veritable death machine! Gunmetal directed Talib and they equipped the battleaxes and javelins from the orc raiders, where they could either be used as weapons as part of the wagon or quickly released to be thrown! They loaded the back of the wagon with cargo to give it some mass. A harness was created for the mighty minotaur, Grosh. 

At his *request*, really more of a demand, a quick-release was built into the harness.

Another quick change to the plan was thrown in, with Talib taking Gunmetal's place on the back of the wagon. From there, Talib could cast [Shield of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield-of-faith) on the Minotaur. A protective gleaming, field of tiny diamond-like crystals shrouded Grosh and made him and his plate armor seem even larger.

They looked over the field and Grosh drew up a plan that involved driving straight downhill at a full (*I really want to say gallop*) run and kicking into high gear right before they entered the field.

The wolves, too busy eating from the fresh carcasses, didn't notice the approaching danger. Which, to be honest, was half of their job. It was almost too late when the orc realized what was happening. He heard Grosh's war cry and felt the ground shaking and another thunderous roar from Talib's [thermaturgy spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thaumaturgy). The orc looked up, but the minotaur was already upon him. The orc never even saw the axe that swung threw him as Grosh flung his body, split to the waist, over his head. Blood and guts were spewed everywhere.

In addition to the two other orcs, a larger orc emerged from the ruins. Adorned in a thicker, woven hide armor, carrying a greataxe, he bellowed. *The Orc's First Warrior* of the tribe came out to join the battle. And from a cave on the hillside, another orc emerged, dressed in greasy, flamboyant skins, with a feathered plum and six small skulls sewn into a crown around his head. In his hand an old weathered staff, with more skins wrapped around it and feathers and dried talons at top. *An orc shaman*

"Damn casters" Manny cursed at  him.

Talib started the battle using his ***spectral weapon*** which was so effective in the last battle, but not so much today. Gunmetal turned to his **arrowless bow**, using the stash of plain, ol' ordinary rocks that he had been collecting along the way and schlepping with him. But like Talib, he also had trouble *finding his range*. Maybe he should try *more exotic ammunition*.

Another orc fell beneath Grosh's mighty weapon. Manny engaged the shaman. And another orc emerged from the ruins, this one large, like the First Warrior, but somehow even more impressive. Clad in studded leather, wielding a scimitar, the blade shining and shimmering in the bright day light. Smarter than some folk, the wolves knew a lost cause when they saw one, scared off by the horned, menacing figure of Grosh and the ground-shaking ***thermaturgy*** was enough for them to beat paws and flee.

However, undeterred, almost as if it were on a mission, a [basilisk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/basilisk), emerged from the shaman's cave. A large lizard, just over ten feet long and four feet tall with bared teeth and terrible spines it came out and began to attack Force Grey.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jIGStYn.png)

***Did you know...*** even if you know it's a basilisk, even if you know that it's gaze can turn a man to stone, it's really hard to look away from this kind of monstrosity especially as it advances on you and your colleagues. And hisses, like a terrible whine - a high pitched whine.

Talib knows. Manny knows. Gunmetal knows. *Well, they know now*. Heck, Talib knows a few times in fact.

What they didn't know was that the basilisk was *newly formed, recently summoned*... a little weaker even. It's fearsome gaze was dilute, buying them a few, extra moments, allowing them to will their way free of the menacing gaze.

The battle raged, with members of Force Grey falling and fighting off the effects of the monster. The First Warrior fell. The shaman fell. And another creature emerged from the cave.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sVaWP9q.jpg)

A lumbering, towering monstrosity. An [Owlbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/owlbear) roared into the battle. A serrated beak and razor-sharp talons, the large beast moved in on Force Grey.

At the end, Force Grey stood victorious, the orc pack and two strange beasts lay dead around the camp. Grosh was his usual, fearsome, lethal force and standing beside him this time was Manny, who stepped up and cleaved his way through the orcs and the owlbear. The basilisk went down, beneath Gunmetal's aim, but was a concerted team effort. 

### Shaman's cave

While Grosh went to investigate the tower, Talib went into search the shaman's cave. No stranger to magic and an experienced Waterdeep investigator, Talib was initially taken aback. Floating above a pit with green flame and embers was a staff. Illuminated in the same eerie glow, two creatures were beginning to form beneath it, in front of the pit.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Gl5V62n.jpg)

Without hesitation, Talib reached out and grabbed the staff. There was some resistance, it held firm for a split second and then came free. The pit went dark, the glow dissipated and the staff went from hot to lukewarm to cold in his hands in seconds.

With the glow, the creatures that were forming also vanished. Talib, who had a less than exemplary day in combat, let out a subtle sigh of relief, and began inspecting the staff. He quickly realized that what he held in his hands was Fazzanach's staff. That strange halfling who *begged* for their help.

The others arrived and Talib explained what he found and showed off the staff. A wizard of a sorts, in his own right, Gunmetal also took a turn looking over the staff. Marveling at the staff and the creatures that it had summoned, Grey wondered aloud whether or not they could trust the halfing. After all, he had told them that the staff wasn't useful.

Joined by Grosh, they conferred and decided that what he had actually said was closer to something like *he was preparing it to be a **vessel** for magic, but it wasn't magic yet. But he hoped that one day...* To which Gunmetal agreed.

Upon more discussion, it was posited, and mostly accepted that the shaman had known or figured out how to do something with or to the staff. And the shaman was clearly using it to summon monsters. Apparently back-to-back, one right after they other they assumed. First the basilisk, then the owlbear, followed by whatever was being manifest.

### tower ruins
The tower ruins were something else. Whether it was the anticipation of the ensuing melee or the heat of the battle, at first the trained investigators didn't put much mind to the broken down tower ruins in the center of the orc camp. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ieKAy49.jpg)

However when the frenzy of battle had subsided, and they were able to spend some time actually looking at the ruins, they all felt a bizarre, inexplicable sense of familiarity and, short of any other description, *creepiness* about the ruins. And... something *wrong*, something disturbing about the large structure.

The members of this team were all experience agents of Force Grey. Each of them were selected for this, *while for the other*, adventure because of their particular backgrounds.

**Manny** from his days investigating with the Watch, to his work after, Manny has come across a number of legends that talk about mysterious tower ruins outside of Waterdeep. He even had some friends in the Guard who made the *regular road trip* to shoo away miscreants and squatters. 
>One story has always stuck with him. The tower ruins have been a shattered state of repair as far back to the age of *[Aelinthaldaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aelinthaldaar)*, the capital of *[Illefarn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illefarn)*, the elf kingdom that once ruled this area. Ancient history, the elves destroyed their own city in -1100 DR (approximately 350 years before *now*). Even way back when, there was no reference to any actual tower, just the ruins. An Illefarn legend tells that before they made their presence widely known in the region, the drow had used the tower ruins, or this area in particular, as an outpost. They would get cleaned out periodically, but one drow clan or another would come back.

**Grosh** Even in his youth, hailing from the far East, Grosh had heard legends from the Sword Coast region. *Familiar* with the ways and lore of the duergar from his area he had heard tell of ruins of a tower that were so revered that he believed them to be mythical.

>*Blackcloack Hold* reigned for almost two hundred years and was established by the insane wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Between 171 and 308 DR, which ended about 1200 years before the Force Grey team were born and about 1000 years after their *now*, Blackcloak conducted a purging of the drow and duergar from Undermountain. It was legendarily very thorough. Legend has it that the tower ruins were the one refuge that these otherwise condemned and trapped tribes had to seek out. Very few made it to the ruins and Blackcloak's hunters who did make that far, never returned. No one knows what happened to those drow or duergar. It was assumed, that somehow, those few who managed to reach the tower escaped, maybe they went East. *And maybe some didn't...

**Talib** has been in Force Grey longer than any of the others on this team. Talib had had a lot of colleagues and associates in the Watch and Guard. As Talib walked around the ruins a lot of things came to mind. There was something obviously sinister about the ruins. Something powerful. But what kept coming to Talib's mind was:
>Waterdeep general policy had a regular City Guard that patrolled out to the *tower ruins* once every month or so. For the most part, it's routine duty, ride out, check the area for squatters or worse and ride back. Once the Guard patrol came upon a troop of Gith, who left them all for dead. One survived long enough to report the encounter, but the Gith were never seen again. There have been no known gith tribes in that frequent this area. After that, a Griffon Rider accompanied the patrol, in case there was a more potent presence. A couple of times a year, someone does get caught trying to set up a camp or outpost and gets thrown out. Rumors of ceremonies being trekked out to the ruins popped up occasionally, sometimes before and sometimes after the fact. When the authorities could, they discouraged it.

**Gunmetal Grey** Where he comes from, there are more legends and mysteries than reliable history. Sometimes. There is often more known about the backstory of a spell or an artifact, than the area surrounding it. So his head was full of lore and myths, but there was something about those ruins that make Gunmetal think of this one peculiar story.
>The legend of *the tower ruins* stretched back before time. Whatever the tower was, it was a place of great power, immense, beyond anything that was ever imaginable. It was said that it's destruction re-shaped the entire universe, that all of the land and sea around it and all of the things living, *and dead?* were re-formed. It is said that no one, in any kingdom or era, has ever tried to rebuild the tower or even build or establish settlement around the tower. *Strange things* befell those who spent too much time there. No matter whether they walked in the light or the dark. No one stayed very long. The existence of the tower ruins was more myth than a geographical fact, as no one had ever put it on a map. 

At least that was a story that Gunmetal had heard, from *where he was from*. And where he was from was so far away, so so far away, that these couldn't be those ruins, *could they*...?

Inside the ruins, Grosh found the orc's stash. The team quickly distributed the goods and loaded some of it back into their war wagon. Surprisingly, the war wagon survived the melee unscathed. They also added the orcs wagons to their own, doubling their wagon total. Huzzah!

The orcs had been using the ruins as the center of their base. Most of the orcs, lived outside and slept on mats or shallow carved out spaces in the ground. The team assessed that there were probably about 30 orcs total. From the looks of it, the chief made his home inside, near a fire pit.

The entire campsite, the ruins included were a mess.

## The Ruins and the Skeleton (March 8, 2021)

And...
It wasn't until Force Grey began to walk around the other side of the ruins that they found the giant skeleton. More accurately, the petrified skeleton embedded in the hillside. Huge and, a bit terrifying, the skeleton loomed over the small entrance to a cavern.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FEyg4Sq.jpg)

The investigation of the skeleton and the tower ruins continued. A more close investigation of the remains led to an estimate that standing, the creature would have been about 27-30 feet tall. There were obvious injuries and there was no markings or carvings on the bones. From what they could tell, the creature had fallen there, and the hillside had continued to grow around it. More dirt fell on it, more moss, more grass. It looked like had been there for a very, very long time. From the remains, none of the agents could tell whether it was some kind of gigantic humanoid or an actual giant of some kind.

In stark contrast to the rest of the campground, the area around the cave entrance was clean. Spotless even. There was no refuge, no carcasses, no sign that the orcs ever went near the cavern. Tracks of the orcs were all around the campsite, but nothing near the cavern or skeleton. As if they didn't know it was there, or avoided it. It was as if the orcs had never even entered the cavern. In the dust and dirt, they could make out a set of footprints that led from the mouth to the back of the cave, to the door. Manny investigated them and determined that he was certain that they were humanoid, probably of average build, but the stride was twice as long as one might expect. And it appeared that the footfalls landed with a heavy weight. They appeared to live right up to the door.

Beside the skeleton was what appeared to be the mouth of a cave. 

The cave inside was about 80 long and 45 feet across. It was dark and cold, as things like this go, more so than they might effect. And remarkably clean, except for some cobwebs, no sign of scat or any other things that might live in a cave like this. No sign of anything at all, other than a large door on the east side of the wall. There was a strange, alluring humming sound coming from the cave. It was both haunting and *the only way to describe it would be **enticing***. Gunmetal suggested that it sounded like it had some kind of rhythm, like some kind of machine.

The door stood, about 9 feet tall and about 10 feet across. The door was remarkable for three reasons:
1. The inscription in the door, carved in an ancient form of under-common with gold highlights:

![](https://i.imgur.com/J0H43ev.jpg)

2. The door had no handle.
3. The door had no hinges. The wood was beautiful and looked both ancient and brand new. In the center of the door on the left, there were nine lines in two columns, carved in what appeared to be duergar.

The team recognized *Malbolge* as one of the rings of hell. There was a *Storm Reach* where Gunmetal was from, but *that can't be right*... *for reasons...* They speculated that alpha-numeric column might be a date or year marker. Especially since they, themselves, were from *Waterdeep at the end of 1492*. 

While the others inspected the door, Grosh went back to the ruins to see if there were any markings or anything in the ruins that were similar to the markings on the door.

Manny attempted to use one of his daggers to push between the frame and the door, to no avail. The blade sunk into the crevice a bit but stopped cold, up and down the door. Grosh, returned without finding anything of note in the ruins, and tried to peer between any of cracks and crevices, but there was nothing else to be seen. Gunmetal stepped up and and cast [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) on the door and was able to detect a powerful spell or spells, on the door. As he leaned back to get a better look at the door, he noticed a panel had appeared beneath the carved letters.

Manny tried to put his dagger into the tiny seam of the panel, to no avail. Gunmetal tried to push it open, and it moved ever so slightly. The mighty Grosh stepped up and pushed it with all his might, moving it up and down and left and right. Suddenly it slid open.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tcZBvnq.jpg)

>Worlds connected 
by a river of stars
kingdoms separated 
by rivers of fools
Time, a river 
that stretches 
behind footfalls 
and ahead of dreams
whose every journey,
begins in the heartland

Gunmetal investigated the strange, colorful mechanism. He ran his fingers over the flowers, only after he had pricked his finger did he notice the very sharp points on the tips of each petal and a stinger in the middle. A bright bead of blood welled up on his fingertip, but dissipated quickly enough he hardly paid it any notice. The others watched carefully, Talib checking to ssee if there was any change in the gnome's demeanor, in case he was poisoned.

Undeterred, Gunmetal looked carefully at the sphere at the top of the lock. A four-inch sphere that appears to have some kind of cloudy substance inside, a dark red substance moved slowly inside. He touched it cautiously, unaware that the blood on his finger had returned. For a second he felt the blood pulled from his finger. It dripped down into the sphere and the turmoil inside became even an even more dark red-purple. It turned and spun and then the door disappeared. In it's place Gunmetal sawa portal that looked similar to the one that they had traveled through back in Waterdeep. On the other side was a frozen room that he couldn't quite make out through a layer of ice and frost. And in the back of his mind he heard:

![](https://i.imgur.com/W4HRy0I.jpg)

>Prick your finger
Open the gate
Do not linger
choose your fate
>
>Your contract sealed
and journey begun
destiny to be revealed
across the mighty river
run

Without hesitation, Gunmetal thought *Waterdeep 1492* and stepped through the portal. As the world spun around him, he could feel himself being transported. His last thought on this plane was *Oh shit, Doggo...*

What the others saw was Gunmetal touching the sphere. Manny noticed a trickle of blood coming out of Grey's finger. Grosh noticed that the sphere had grown darker, more angry. And Talib stood silently as the gnome just vanished.

Manny and Talib turned and looked at Grosh and then back at the door, a bit surprised that he wasn't the one to vanish. Or be disintegrated... but somehow, after all that they had been through and seen, they didn't think he was destroyed.

For one, there were no remains. Which isn't a perfect conclusion to draw, but had some merit.

They debated going back Tyr's Burden. After all Talib still had Fazzanach's staff, which they had promised to return. Manny was all for going back and reconnoitering. There was a part of him who wanted nothing more than to go back to Horace Harper and compare notes about their findings. Though, he suspected that no one from the sleepy hamlet would know anything.

Manny and Talib debated the meaning of the bad poem. They suspected that it referenced some kind of *time travel*: "Time, a river
that stretches behind footfalls and ahead of dreams"

Manny thought maybe the blood of the individuals was important to the *heartland* or home of someone using the door. Talib, his studies of medicine and divinity, suggested that the heart was also the center of the blood in one's body.

They all wondered whether the different flowers would have a different effect.

Meanwhile, Grosh took matters into his own hand and pricked his finger on the same purple flower and then touched the sphere. And in an instance he was also gone.

With a shrug and a sigh, Talib and Manny looked at each other. Neither committed entirely to meeting the fate of their comrades. They retrieved one of the dead orc raiders and Talib put its fingers to one of the flowers and then on the sphere. The blood rolled down the sphere, but nothing happened. Manny solemnly pointed out that it wasn't too bad here, *Tyr's Burden*, that they had it pretty nice. Talib nodded, understanding and with almost a vague look of regret on his face, he reached over and stuck his finger firmly on to the sharp edges of the purple flower. A second after he touched the sphere, he was gone too.

Manny looked back at the mouth of the cave. What did he owe these guys? *Force Grey*, the special arm, the *surgical tool* of the City Watch. The same Watch that... *well that's another story*. Besides, *misfits*, the three of them were misfits, barely fit in anywhere, but they had shared some ground. *What of it, he'd shared a lot of ground with a lot of folk. Some good, some...* But these guys were good. He, maybe, even liked them, a little. And *Force Grey*. It wasn't the Watch or the Guard, it was something else. And they didn't just *take anyone*, And he had promises to keep. His resolve hardening, he turned and looked at the mouth of the cavern one more time and then pricked his finger on the purple flower.

Swearing and cursing all three of his companions, he vanished. 
Gone. All of them, the cave empty again, except for...

### If the *River of Time* were a room
![](https://i.imgur.com/SHI1PVf.jpg)


They all appeared in the small alcove in front of a stone wall. In the wall, inset, like the wooden door in the cavern was *what appeared to be a stone door*. A plain stone slab, with no discernable markings. 

At their feet, a small stream of water ran ***up the stairs*** towards them and into the base of the wall/door behind them.

In front of them was a large room full of *water*, with stone platforms floating on the surface. On the other side of the room was another set of stairs leading out of the water, to another door.

To either side of them there were two dry pools. At the either end of the dry pools was a four and a half foot statue of a cat of some sort, in the center of another, smaller stone circle. On one side, the statue was severely damaged with parts of the statue all around the stone base. On the other side the statue was in pristine shape, completely unblemished, at it's feet a very small amount of *water*.

Inspecting it more carefully, Gunmetal, now without his trusted robot companion, determined that the broken material around the statue was indeed part of the statue. And peering down the steps, he believed that it was only a shallow pool.

At first they were careful not to touch the water. But that too bore inspection. Manny threw a dagger at one of the platforms. It crashed off an careened into the air and vanished. As they would ordinarily. Gunmetal, determined to see what would happen if a weapon hit the water threw his infused handaxe at one of the platforms. It bounced off and fell into the water. He *recalled* the axe and it flew straight to his hand.

Grosh dropped an arrow into the stream at his feet. It appeared unharmed. Talib dropped a bolt into the stream and it floated, eventually, to the wall at the back of the alcove.

While the others inspected the strange *water*, viscous and creepy, Grosh sized up the platforms. About three and a half feet on each side, they all seemed to move a few inches from side to side, to and fro. And then, without warning he leapt to the nearest platform.

It seemed sturdy. Holding steady even his enormous weight. 

Manny, also now sizing up the platforms, thought maybe he ccould pull one over. Gunmetall suggested that if they could get a bunch them he could fashion... *a bridge*...? But instead of trying to lasso one of the platforms, he created a large loop and threw it to Grosh.

Grosh almost lost his *footing* when he looked down to attach the rope. While Gunmetal thought the pool was shallow, from where he stood, Grosh could see no bottom! He quickly, carefully attached the rope and then leapt 7to the next platform. And that's when the trouble began.

While Manny and company were unsuccessfully trying to dislodge the platform, Grosh discovered a new problem. Suddenly he found himself confronted by *Talib*, standing on the water, reading to attack him. Grosh looked back at the rest of his team. Manny was still here. *And here too*. His battle-honed skills ready, he struck first at the dopleganger, but missed. *Talib*  swung his flaming mace at the minotaur, but also missed.

Manny seeing something amiss on Grosh's platform, jumped over to one as well. Suddenly, beside him *Gunmetal Grey* was standing **on the water** next to him. A quick double-take and he saw that the real Gunmetal was still on the side of the pool, sizing up the jump to a platform. They scuffled daggers slicing through the air, *Gunmetal* drew first blood.

From the edge of the pool, the rest of Force Grey saw their companions, on their own, doing some kind of macabre dance. From solid ground, they couldn't see the *imposters*.

Talib leaped to the last platform. *Manny* appeared beside him. Steel flashed and a battle of daggers began.

Grosh and *Talib* continued their battle, this time, for the first time, *Talib* landed a blow with his mace and used it's mighty force to send Grosh into the *water*. Sinking, a bit, in his magical armor, Grosh willed himself back to the surface.

Still unsure of what was going on, but seeing an open platform, Gunmetal leaped to into the stone plate, only to find *Grosh* standing in front of him.

Seeing Grosh in peril, Manny tied one end of his rope to a weapon and dropped into the pool for Grosh and then bolted past for the other side of the pool, the rope trailing behind him. A veritable life-line for the minotaur. Manny ran and jumped, *Talib* and *Gunmetal* chasing after him.

*to be continued 3/24.*
