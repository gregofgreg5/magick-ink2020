## *Marshoon, WHO...?*
**Jarik**

Jarik can't shake *this whole Manshoon thing*, aside from being the creepiest thing that he'd ever seen, he can't let go of the connection. He embarked on a litle leg-work, checking at a the Waterdeep library and a couple of local temple's collection of tomes. Careful not to mention or be noticed searching for the wizard, his research confirmed this information:

>**Manshoon** (pronounced: /mɑːnˈʃuːn/ man-SHOON) was one of the original founders of the **Zentharim** or the **Black Network** (1261). Evil to the core, he made enemies all across Faerun, including other powerful spellcasters such as Khelben Arunsun and Elminster. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, Manshoon magically crafted several clones-but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Manshoon Wars. All but three of the clones were destroyed. Two of those met their demise in their own adventures. The third, the last clone of Manshoon, had retreated into the Undermountain, where he had a final, fatal confrontation the rival sorceror Halastar Blackcloak, some time around 1370.

## Writ of Parole

29  Nightal 1492

**Barakka, Luzieros, Jarik and Ursula** had been summmoned to the Office of the Magister. When they arrived they find **Captain Guryon, Sargent  Cromley, Barnibus Blastwind and Guard Aumarr (*Captain*) Shain Ravenhook** and **Civilar (*lieutenant*) Girogi Blackspear** waiting for them in the outer office of the Magister. They were escoted in, weapons and all, to Kylynne Silmerhelve's inner chamber. Silmerhelve, a stately, official-looking mature tiefling woman, wearing the standard black robes of her office bid the adventuers to sit down. She told them that "they have been a very contested topic of conversation around these halls lately. That Waterdeep is a city of tradition and order, where the law is above all else. And, that since you've been here, you all seem to be oblivious to this or *perhaps are being drawn obliviously* into trouble."

She actually paused for effect. *It works*, "There are some," she very purposefully did not make any indications, "who believe that you are trouble magnets or perhaps even instigators, that left to your own devices, that you would have Waterdeep turned head over tail into one of those lawless *pirate islands*. There are others who are quick to point out that you and your friends have done several significant services, including rescuing two respected citizens from the clutches of... *I can't even keep track of that mess...*, and in the processes rendered some very nafarious individuals who have plauged this city of late. It might be said that we already have *big trouble* and that you are more ally than accelerant."

"I believe the commment was that *you are making the right enemies.* Be that as it may, the Lords of Waterdeep have impressed upon this office to recognize both your service in the city, your successful restoration of Trollskull manor - I might add in record time - **and** that your alliance, *such that it is* has also undertaken a significant boon on behalf of the Lords, travelling to the Mere of Deadmen."

"It has therefore been ordered that you be given **a Writ of Parole** which will give you the right to carry arms in the City of Waterdeep, for the expressed purposes of self-defense and to defend other Waterdavians in imminent danger. This writ does not bestow any martial or municipal powers and you are still subject to the laws of our land, with the caveat of the aforementioned **duties**. It has been requested that it be specified that you, as are all who are within our City limits, are forbidden from accosting, harassing or assualting *anyone*. But it is not this Office's intention to render you helpless, when it is clear that you have demonstrated yourselves a great *help* to us already."

And with that Guryon produced **four** official writs and handed out one to each of you. The gathered officers offer you *congratulations, of sorts*, and you are turned out into the street without any further ado.

**to be continued**
