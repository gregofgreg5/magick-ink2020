# What happens in between

## *Marshoon, WHO...?*
**Jarik**

Jarik can't shake *this whole Manshoon thing*, aside from being the creepiest thing that he'd ever seen, he can't let go of the connection. He embarked on a litle leg-work, checking at a the Waterdeep library and a couple of local temple's collection of tomes. Careful not to mention or be noticed searching for the wizard, his research confirmed this information:

>**Manshoon** (pronounced: /mɑːnˈʃuːn/ man-SHOON) was one of the original founders of the **Zentharim** or the **Black Network** (1261). Evil to the core, he made enemies all across Faerun, including other powerful spellcasters such as Khelben Arunsun and Elminster. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, Manshoon magically crafted several clones-but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Manshoon Wars. All but three of the clones were destroyed. Two of those met their demise in their own adventures. The third, the last clone of Manshoon, had retreated into the Undermountain, where he had a final, fatal confrontation the rival sorceror Halastar Blackcloak, some time around 1370.

## Writ of Parole

29  Nightal 1492

**Barakka, Luzieros, Jarik and Ursula** had been summmoned to the Office of the Magister. When they arrived they find **Captain Guryon, Sargent  Cromley, Barnibus Blastwind and Guard Aumarr (*Captain*) Shain Ravenhook** and **Civilar (*lieutenant*) Girogi Blackspear** waiting for them in the outer office of the Magister. They were escoted in, weapons and all, to Kylynne Silmerhelve's inner chamber. Silmerhelve, a stately, official-looking mature tiefling woman, wearing the standard black robes of her office bid the adventuers to sit down. She told them that "they have been a very contested topic of conversation around these halls lately. That Waterdeep is a city of tradition and order, where the law is above all else. And, that since you've been here, you all seem to be oblivious to this or *perhaps are being drawn obliviously* into trouble."

She actually paused for effect. *It works*, "There are some," she very purposefully did not make any indications, "who believe that you are trouble magnets or perhaps even instigators, that left to your own devices, that you would have Waterdeep turned head over tail into one of those lawless *pirate islands*. There are others who are quick to point out that you and your friends have done several significant services, including rescuing two respected citizens from the clutches of... *I can't even keep track of that mess...*, and in the processes rendered some very nafarious individuals who have plauged this city of late. It might be said that we already have *big trouble* and that you are more ally than accelerant."

"I believe the commment was that *you are making the right enemies.* Be that as it may, the Lords of Waterdeep have impressed upon this office to recognize both your service in the city, your successful restoration of Trollskull manor - I might add in record time - **and** that your alliance, *such that it is* has also undertaken a significant boon on behalf of the Lords, travelling to the Mere of Deadmen."

"It has therefore been ordered that you be given **a Writ of Parole** which will give you the right to carry arms in the City of Waterdeep, for the expressed purposes of self-defense and to defend other Waterdavians in imminent danger. This writ does not bestow any martial or municipal powers and you are still subject to the laws of our land, with the caveat of the aforementioned **duties**. It has been requested that it be specified that you, as are all who are within our City limits, are forbidden from accosting, harassing or assualting *anyone*. But it is not this Office's intention to render you helpless, when it is clear that you have demonstrated yourselves a great *help* to us already."

And with that Guryon produced **four** official writs and handed out one to each of you. The gathered officers offer you *congratulations, of sorts*, and you are turned out into the street without any further ado.

## Softsong & Fazzanachs

With the deaths of Falrin & Casita Softsong and Joyius & Quiola Fazzanch,, the Tavern’s resident mistrels, in the fireball incident, being in or very-near their majority, Sanamin and her brother Ordin Softsong, and Xanyas Fazzanch have taken up living and working in Trollskull Manor.

Following the death of their parents in the fireball incident Sanamin and her brother Ordin Softsong, and Xanyas Fazzanch have taken up living and working in Trollskull Manor. Sanmina and Xanyas had already reached their majority, by recognized halfling standards, Ordin is only a few years behind. The three of them had already been working in the Manor and it was easy for Hannah and company to make extra space for them to live.

Sanamin and Ordin spend most of their time working: cleaning or cooking with Hannah. They seem to be focused on working their way through their grief. It is easy to see that both are still clearly devastated by their loss, but they appreciate the good-natured camaraderie in the tavern. Xanayas is a different story, he seems to be becoming more and more sullen with each passing day. His good nature and pleasant smile still fill any room he walks into, but beneath that thin veneer there is a palpable sadness. There have been times when he has even been *short* or snapped at someone, when he almost seems morose. Very uncharacteristic for the young halfling. He also seems to miss Borl. *There’s one in every crowd*.

## The Arrival of Peyton Song of Tyr

01 Hammer 1493

Fresh on the morn, the spectacle of a lavish, albeit short priest and his retinue arrive at Trollskull Manor in search of Barakka. The priest introduces himself as “Peyton Song of Tyr, of the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter”, seemingly very proud of coming from the grand temple in Neverwinter. Peyton, an old *friend* of Barakka, has come to deliver a special gift, bestowed upon him by right and his personal honor. He invites everyone to a ceremony in morning in which he will bestow the might weapon ***MorningBlade*** upon Barakka.

Barakka seems both irked and happy to see the diminutive priest, who had once been both his chaperone and mentor. However, Barakka is quite elated to learn that MourningBlade would finally passed to his hands.

After Peyton and his entourage leave, Barakka explains that MourningBlade was created by the High Mage Alustriel Silverhand, when she was the ruler of Silverymoon, for his great, great great, great grandfather Thorn Shieldstrong. Thorn had been a great warrior, champion in the Orc-Troll War in 1276. The sword has been passed, through (he actually rolled his eyes) a ritual process, to the greatest warrior of his family. It was last weilded by his father’s father, Ord, over fifty years ago. It is easy to sense that Barakka sees this as a great honor, and equally that he believes that he should have had it before now.

Those who wish to, attend the ceremony for Barakka at the Hall of Justice (Tyr’s temple here in Waterdeep also). It is long and as much about Peyton Song of Tyr as it is about Barakka, whose name it is revealed is actually **Leonard Shieldstrong**, a surprise to most of you. Equally surprising. Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep was chief of among the attendees at the ceremony. She seemed very familiar with Petyon and everyone was shocked when she greeted Barakka cordially, even friendlily!
As it turns out, Peyton has accepted a position at the Waterdeep Hall of Justice and promises that he will frequently stop by the tavern to check in on Barakka!

## The Adventure Continues

Six days have passed since the clandestine agreement between the tavernlords and Marshoon. While busy investigating, few leads have turned up. Most discouraging, there has been absolutely no word on the whereabout of Urstel Floxin, the Zhent assassin seen fleeing Trollskull Alley the day of the fireball. It is also becoming clear that whatever Borl is up to, it is unlikely that any information from him will arrive in a timely manner. *Perhaps the team wants to investigate the House of Inspired Hands as well*…

Here are some of the main options to consider next:
* Investigate the automaton at House of the Inspired Hand
* Previous inquiries to the Office of the Harbor Master have been, interesting, but not particularly useful. Though the team has realized that information and actual action on the docks changes frequently, so another visit might be in order.

Or…?
