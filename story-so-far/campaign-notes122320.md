## The End of a Really Bad Week
**23 Nightal 1492**

It had already been a complicated week that started with a Xantharian firebombing and included half of the adventurers being sent on a mission to the **Mere of Dead Men**. The journey to the mere alone promised to be at at least twenty days. As if that weren't enough, the party gathered this morning to find that one of their own, the Mon-K'ee, had left. Leaving behind **osprey, the Sinister knife** and **the Sinister ring** for Borl. While discussing Mon-K'ee's departure, Borl discovered another package. This one wrapped and hidden underneath a bench, which he quickly passed off to Barakka to inspect.

**Ursula**

Inside was a small wooden box with no marking or latches. When Barakka opened it, a brilliant light and smoke filled the room. The whispy forms of green, winged-snakes swirled round the room in the smoke, as two hulking figures materialized in the center of the room: ogres! During the pitched battle with the monsters, **Ursula**, an armored polar bear standing over seven feet tall arrived to lend a paw. Jarik's new *shield guardian* blasted into the fight and almost single-handedly dispatched one of the ogres. However, before the second ogre could be dealt with a thurnderous explosion rocked Trollskull Alley. A bright light, from the tavern windows burst into the room as the whole street shook.

A bright light and blistering heat could be felt through the front doors and windows. They quickly finished off the last ogre and the whole team (what's left of it) and Emmitt, who arrived to also assist in the battle, rushed outside to aid the injured and determine the cause of the destruction. There were dozens of injured people milling about and eleven fatalities: an unfamiliar elderly woman out for a walk, three servants from the wealthy North Ward: two human females and a male half-ef who had been on the Alley running errands, a male gnome wearing a fine outfit covered by a burnt cloak, grasping a dagger, two cloaked sellswoards, with their swords still bound into their scabbards and Falrin & Casita Softsong and Joyius & Quiola Fazzanch, the four halfling minstrels who had spent so many hours at the Tavern lately.  

Devistated by the deaths of their friends, the adventurers pressed on, investigating the scene and interviewing witnesses. Jarik disovered aa small parchment tucked in the pocket of the gnome. Luzieros did his best to find someway to save souls for Talos. After hearing that a third sellsword had taken something from the gnome and made good his escaped down the Alley towards the Bent Nail, Barakka chased through the gathering crowd after him. Meanwhile, Borl inspected and removed one of the the buttons securing one of the sellswords' weapons: a small metal button painted black with the image of a winged serpent. A stranger on the Alley, Ursula did her best to help calm the crowd while keeping a close eye on Jarik. Emmett found young Martem Trec, a 12-year old halfling, a freind to both the minstrels and tavern keepers. Martem had been hiding behind some water barrels near the Alley, clutching something to his chest. The boy had been hiding behind the barrel when he heard something drop into it. Curious, he fished out a chain with five small orbs, that seemed almost animated by a small fire inside of each one. *A necklace of fireballs*. **Iefyr Qifaren**, a female elf, had been down to Bookworm’s Treasure doing some local research, she saw the three sellswords chasing the gnome and shouting at him. She couldn't be sure, but she thought they were headed towards Trollskull Manor.

The team knew time was running short, noticing the aerial member of the Griffon Calvary, one of Waterdeep's defenders, circling over head. The City Guard arrives en masse, while two represenatives from the City Watch: **Sargent Saeth Cromley** and **Captain Guryon** also make the scene, with **Barnibus Blastwind**, from *Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors*, in their company. It wasn't long before the adventurers/tavern keepers were the center of attention. Barakka arrived, empty-handed, as the Guard commander was urging the Watch to place the team in custody. They had already begun to insist that the party surrender their *unautorized* weapons. Guryoon and Barakka conferred they all agreed that the rest of this conversation best held inside. The Guard commander, a couple of his men and the Watch contingent followed the team into the tavern while the rest of the Guard surrounded the building. *We're all friends here, until we're not*.

Inside, they were surprised to find the two ogres arranged and the rest of the tavern more or less put back together. The work of Hannah, Jake and Lif. The fire bomb, the ogres and now a fireball outside their doorstep, the City Guard commander was more and more convinced that if the party wasn't a involved, they were a magnet for trouble and needed to be kept in safer confines. Sargeant Cromley was beginning to agree. Barakka, Jarik and Luzieros argued their case as victims, making no recognition of the continued requests to surrender their weapons. Finally, Guryon, reminded the rest of the City protectors, that these were the folk responsible for taking down that Zhent crew on the docks a few weeks ago and after that they had overturned one of the Xanathar's dens, killing three prominent Xanthar Lieutenants in the process. The commander continue to argue thse facts made them more of a danger to civilians, pointing at recent acts as evidence. Finally, Barnibus weighed in on the side of the party, citing that while they may be dangerous and a danger to be to close to, that they were making the correct enemies and that perhaps the city should be doing more to assist them, rather than arrest them. As tensions were clearly starting to ease, Ursula and Emmett *went to the kitchen get get refreshments* and confirm that they were surrounded. While the Guards standing post were visibily discomforted by Borl's presence.

Having won that battle, Jarik and Luzerios made the argument that they should be allowed to help interview and investigate the crime scene, being more familiar with the neighborhood. While pretty much everyone else disagreed, again Barnibus supported their argument and Guryon fell in line. While investigating the carnage, the party learned that the gnome had been identified as Dalakhar, an confidant of the former Open Lord Dagult Neverember. A clear connection to the on-going *Dragon* nonsense was drawn and the members of the Guard and the Watch grew even more concerned. 

Captain Guryon remained behind, after the rest of the City's contingent departed. He explained, that while honeorable and noble, that Barakka's request that the halfling's bodies be remanded into their custody would be denied and that a proper next of kin could claim them, through official channels. He tells you that while he, and some key others, are mostly comfortable with you guys, just about everyone thinks that at least *some of you are off-putting*. And you’re new to Waterdeep and as much as many people seem to like you (him included) there’s a deep-running local-bias that runs through Waterdeep. He also shares with them that the man whom Fala saw, and Barakka chased, matches the description of Urstul Floxin, a suspected member of the Black Network. 

He continues that something is stirring in the **Zhentarim**. They have always had a presence in Waterdeep, but they have mostly been splintered and fragmented. But lately, there seem to be more of them and they seem more aggressive, *gesturing around at the ogres*. **The Xanathar**, who have always been a nuisance, have also taken a much more forceful response. *He’s not saying that they tolerate the Xanathar*, but, this is next level. There is speculation (*remember he’s pretty well connected*) that both sides have been importanting talent and while the Xanathar have had a foothold in this region for a long time, the Zhentarim have a much larger, global network. And they have put a bounty on you guys. Barakka asked if the Black Network had any connection tot he black ship in the harbor, Guryon, quickly denied any knowledge or association with that ship saying that whatever, whoever they are, they do their best to stay out of trouble in Waterdeep and we let them. *He does suggest that if you wanted more information about them, you should ask your **friends** at the Office of the Harbor Master*.

Sometime after Guryon leaves, almost as if they had been waiting for just such an opportunity, **Victor Trench**, the local priviate detective and a stately woman, a Waterdavian, clearly born of wealth and privilege arrive. Trench has brought his client in to tell what she saw: *"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It had been on the roof, where it's cape blowing in the wind caught her eye. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"* She doesn't know what the "puppet" hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn't know where it went.

After a brief discussion, the "marionette" is similar to the automotons that march in the [**Day of Wonders** parade](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Day_of_Wonders). The most likely place to find one of these is the [***House of the Inspired Hands***](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Inspired_Hands#Inhabitants).

Not surprisingly, Trench would not tell them why his client was there and assured them that, that was all she knew. After she left, he also told them what he had turned up in his investigations on their behalf. *"The Xanathar are buzzing around like you've kicked their hornets nest. They are pissed and want retribution for their losses. They have also put up a bounty on you,, but it's unclear if they are mustering a genuine direct attack, at this time."*

The Zhents on the other hand are definitely, *well he thinks* are more likely, to keep coming at you and escalating their attacks. The Zhentarim, the Black Network, as he's sure you all know, are a vast organization that spreads across Faerun and beyond. But typically, they are more like a smaller, loosely connected factions with varying interests, than some singularly purposed criminal empire. *Not like the old days*. Lately however, there has been a huge *in-flux* of *extra-muscle*, different Zhent factions showing up in Waterdeep. Most notably, a couple of months ago a particularly *dangerous sounding* faction arrived on the Crimson Sail. Noteably, he continues, the party killed one of their number, *Jarrack*, when he tried to ambush them in the streets. Trench isn't sure what's going on, but he tells you that the way that the Zhent have operated in Waterdeep has changed, of late. Even some of their *more recognized, almost legit social-political connections* have become more reclusive and less available. And among some of the more unscrupulous brigands, *thugs*, there is an excitement that something is coming soon, like they expect a *big change* and to *be on top* very soon. He doesn't know what to make of it, but there is some kind of *"second coming"* that is being cautiously, but excitedly whispered about. They also have a bounty on the team, all of the team.

The party also seeks out an audience with Renear Neverember, which isn't difficult, since the noble continues to be very grateful for your timely rescue and even considers (*most of you*) friends. He is happy to tell you all that he knows about Dalakhar. *"That little shit had been left behind to keep an eye on me. *But you really don't want to mess with the Harpers*," he starts to brag, but remembers his company and shrugs, "unless said Harper is two sheets to the wind and gets nabbed by a few Zhents..." he shakes his head and continues, "he was small time in my father's operation. He had been watching me, for months, we allowed it figuring the better to know who and what he was seeing, but we finally chased him off about two tendays ago.  My father didn't trust many people, but he trusted that gnome."

"After I heard about what happened today, I spoke to a few of Dalakhar's friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve ***the Stone of Golorr*** and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Golorr to my father in Neverwinter."

Barakka, who has hatched a plan with Jarik and Luzeiros, asks Renear for a favor. He tells him that *Young Jake Silverado, has a lot of his father's admirable qualities, but was a little too much to handle, as a soldier. He's a good kid, but needs some structure and direction. We were hoping, maybe you could help him get into the Harpers.*

Having gotten to know Emmett, Hannah and Jake around the Tavern, Renear is thrilled at the opportunity. Emmett's presence, confidence and competence speaks volumes of the type of soldier he was. He has even befriended Jake a bit and completely understands where Barakka is coming from. He is thrilled to mentor Jake into the Harpers.

*And a plan is hatched.*

It is also decided that the fireball necklace should be turned over to the authorities. Jarik turns the necklace over to Barnibus Blastwind at the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors. He explains that one of their staff had acquired it in the scrum and had not reported it to them until after the authorities had left. Grateful for the assistance, Barnibus thanks him and takes the beads.

*They did keep one of the fireball beads, which* (to some surprise) *was left in Luzerios' possession.*

The party considers their options.
* Investigate the automoton at House of the Inspired Hands
* See what can be learned at the Office of the Harbor Master, *maybe even begin an investigation into the Crimson Sail*...
... and Luzeiros suggests...
* Why don't we try to go talk to the Zhents

It was decided that Borl will go investigate the House of the Inspired Hands, and may take a few weeks away, investigating *along the docks*. An idea that everyone is pretty okay with. Especially Ursula, *he kinda creeps her out*. And that the party would reach out to Victor Trench to set up an meeting to discuss an *armistice*.

## Meeting the Zhentarim
**Two days later**

In the afternoon, Victor Trench returns with an invitation to meet with the Zhentarim at midnight. The party agrees and he tells them that a representative will come to the Tavern to fetch them. They agree.

At midnight, **Davil Starsong** and a cadre of eight swordsmen arrive at Trollskull Manor. Starstrong, has been accorded the title of Master of Opportunities and Negotiation in the Zhent's local network for the past five years. He is one of the Zhent features that Trench will tell them has been less visible and self-sure, over the past few months. Regardless, he arrives to take the team to their meeting. Unbeknownst to the adventurers at the time, one of the swordsmen was **Ziraj the Hunter**, one of their most feared assassins.

The party is taken to ***Old Tower*** which was built hundred of years ago by a mostly-forgetten wizard whose only legacy is thie dilapidated structure. Inside, the tower the ceilings are 15 feet high and The tower is brightly lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces. They are led to the second floor where the are a dozen or so swordsmen, who join Davil, Ziraj and a hooded figure seated at the lone table and chair. As they enter, the figure rises to greet them and they see that is a surprisingly old, frail but nimble human. *A wizard of some kind to experienced eyes*. 

Without giving them an actual introduction, they learn that the wizard *calls himself **Manshoon*** and he is very deliberate and animated in all of his actions. Each motion is frequently over-exaggerated or repeated over and over for effect. *It's more creepy than annoying that he also refers to himself in the **third person***. There is a genuine sense of menace and danger throughout the room, if not from the guards, from Manshoon himself. Negotiations go back and forth, and the party begin to wonder if Manshoon's *deck really has many things*. The offer is essentially this: **Help the Black Network** find the Dragons, so that they can rise to power or be killed. While no immediate threat is made, *and Luzieros has done the math, a Thunderwave or the fireball bead would be a bad, bad call in these close quarters*.

Their discomfort increases, as a shadowy, hooded figure seems to materialize behind Manshoon. It moved with graceful, powerful, almost pacing strides. Dangerous yellow eyes peered out from under the hood as it moved around Manshoon, occassionally whispering to him. **Mr. Shadow** ,they learn, and can finally put a (very disturbing) picture to the enemy who kicked Erethil from the roof during the battle with Jarrack. Mr. Shadow seems to be as much counsel to Manshoon as he is a menace to the party. Finally, with Mr. Shadow's tacit agreement, the party concedes to what they believe is the offer that they're going to get: **They find the Stone or Dragons, they turn them over to the Zhentarim here, at this tower. If the Zhents find either of those first, the party will have 48 hours before the hunt to kill them begins.**

Jarik, in a drunken state, took a while to remember where he had heard the name *Manshoon* before. He kept thinking it had something to do with the Zhentarim, though he admited that assumption could be being influenced by their current situation. But there was something, maybe something about "Manshoon" and the beginning of the Zhentarim, but that didn't make sense. The Zhents have been around for over two hundred years...
