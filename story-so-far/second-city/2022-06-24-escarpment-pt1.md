### Missing Folk

#### The Escarpment
> Renzi learned that there had been a rash of "missing people" in the WindFall territory, which lies between three and six days east of Second City.
>
>It's uncommon when Renzi initiates anything, and ya'll are always up for an adventure so you packed up and headed to WindFall.

**Rezni**: Walked

**Felix**: Walked

**The Great Barbushka**: Battle Cat

**Tomislav**: Lizard

**Biz**: Walked

>Between Second City and Windfall there are three main enclaves and a few more or less nomadic tibes cooperative tribes in the area.
>
>As you made your way east, you learned that there have been a lot of disappearances. Seemingly random, with no connections between who, when or where the folk disappeared from.
>
>On the outskirts of Windfall there is a small militia made up of troop from a few of the neighbor enclaves. For the most part, they keep away the small, wild predators that might stalk the crops or livestock and keep away or the random hostile elements might mean an enclave harm. There aren't many of these *rangers* (that's what they call themselves) and they're only barely competent. However, they did find something for the Detachment to check out.
>
>They had sent out a squad to investigate/search the area when a prominent halfling farmer went missing. The squad never returned, but a rescue (scout) team tracked them to a ridge along one othe mountainous ranges about three days away (about ten days from Second City). Four *rangers* (two elves, a human and a tabaxi) led the Detachment to the mouth of a trailhead at the base of the escarpment.

### The Trailhead
From the trailhead, they could barely make out an encampment of somekind on the highest *shelf*. Castigan, *because that's what monks do*, estimated that there was probably about a 8,000 foot elevation gain between where they were at the trailhead to the encampment. They couldn't exactly call it the *summit* as there was a peak above that shelf.

The trail was a large series of switchbacks that climb the escarpment. The sheer walls between 15 and 25 feet high between shelves. As they took stock of the situation, Castigan's *eagle eyes*, oops - keen sight watched as half a dozen *carrion* birds were shot down from the top shelf of the escarpment. 

Above them on the lowest shelf, they could see three strange statues that were as odd in their appearance as they were out of place in the otherwise empty trail. The statues did not look like fierce or noble wwarriors, heroes, statesmen, or even great beauties. They looked like commoners, ordinary folk - more like the rangers than the Detachment. Harmless even, frozen in awkward poses, their faces contorted or slack-jawed, their eyes blankly staring off into the distance.

Castigan flew up ahead slightly, and the rest of the team  started to make their way up to the next level, when all heck broke loose. The rangers *turned on them*, panicking - attacking the Detachment! And before they knew what had started, the statues came to life and also started attacking them!

The rangers started their attacks with their longbows and switched to shortswords when they were within melee range. The statues' hands contorted into strange talons raking and slashing.

In combat, the Detachment came to life! Castigan carved through two of the statues and took down the tabaxi ranger. Felix made easy work of the last statue. Enraged, Biz tore through the two elf rangers and finished off the human ranger throwing his handaxe into his chest. The Great Barbushka, Master of Fate gleefluly moved through the battlefield with arrows bouncing off his shield, aiding others with his magicks, shile slowing down their adversaries. Rezni took a beating, mostly from the elfin archer that Tomislav had thrown off the ledge.  The only casualty was The Great Barbuska's owl, who after lending aid to Tomislav, saw one of the statues closing in on Castigan's blindside. WIthout hesitation, the familiar swooped between the attack sacrificing itself to save the eagle/human monk.

The danger dispatched, they compared notes. The rangers appeared to have thought that they were fighting some other enemy. They conjectured whether or not the statues or proximity to the statues had somehow affected them. Castigan and Biz found three more statues on the trail ahead of them. Behind them, around the turn of the switch, the rest of the party encounterd a strange field of rocks that seemed only slightly less out of place than the statues. There were a handful of medium rocks and one large one, surrounded by dozens and dozens smaller ones.

Above them... the encampment *and whom or whatever* shot down the carrion birds and whatever lay between them on the rest of **the escarpment**.
