## Rezni
Carter (*Grey*)
Druid/Sorcerer
Goblin ([Verdan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/169862-verdan) )

Characterized as a weird hermit/shaman who lives on the outskirts of town. He has quite a backstory, seems kind of crazy.
Showed up around Second City right before the Horde invasion began, joined the fight and has been a good dude to have around ever since.

## *7 of Gnome* (Name may change)
Chad (*fonix*)
Artificer

7 was built to assist the blacksmith who arms the city guard, but the wizard decided it should be smart. Once it started engineering on its own and got ideas, it became more trouble than help and the smith made a deal to treat it like a person with a job instead of a slave. At some point it was temporarily deputized by the city watch and never gave back the badge.

Kind of a *fixture* in Second City, his day job is as a competent and sought out blacksmith but when he's not slaving away at the forge he can often be found *keeping the peace* around town. While he doesn't have any actual recognized authority, his renown from the Horde Invasion and his *lawful* and mostly kind disposition, keeps him in good favor with everyone.

## Castigan
Cody (*codyseus*)
Monk
*Well, he looks like* an Eagle Aarococka*

Hailing from a temple in the far north, Castigan is a good fella to have around. So long as you don't *ruffle his feathers*. While he might appear like an eagle aarococka, he'll tell you - insist, in fact, that he's human. *Don't go there*.

## Felix
Lee (*Earen*)
Monk 
Tabaxi

Not the "Name of the Rose", or Friar Tuck type monk, more a dude steeped in the fundamental spirtualness of his own being sort of *cat*.

The *Detachment* freed Felix from the Horde and he joined their ranks and has been a friend and asset ever since.

## Rolf
Ted (*Vaelthrine*)
Barbarian
Bugbear

Rolf hails from a nearby tribe, the sixth son (and 13th overall offsping) of the bugbear chieftan family, ~~Hans~~ Rolf's prospects were dim for maintaining any kind of reasonably *high-profile* stature that a bear of his magnitude would deserve. An impressive figure and well-suited for martial combat, Rolf decided to join the city's force against the battle of the Horde. He led a group of five warriors from his tribe, and though they found it difficult to get through the Horde's flank, they did what they could against lone vilains or small groups when they came across them. The *Detachment* found them and took them in and his exploits in the battle became legendary.

In Second City he revels in a level of recognition and respect, and even fame that would never have had in his tribe. 

## Tomislav
Andy (*losttrain*)
Fighter/ Wizard
Human
Race: Human (variant)
As a young soldier, Tomislav’s company was attacked by an overwhelming number of undead. He watched as his comrades were killed, and while his hand was being eaten. Horribly scarred both physically and emotionally, he decided that a fighter’s life was not for him and turned to the arcane, seeking magical and unnatural solutions to the undead problem plaguing the land. While his *replacement* left hand is more mysterious, **7 of Gnome** helped him replace his right leg and has helped in him make repairs on it as needed, ever since. He decided to get back into the fight when the Horde came and to seek revenge for what was done to him on the undead or anyone who fit the bill. His Second City cadre was demolished days into their defense. While most of the warriors were killed, the Horde found his left hand *interesting* and kept him alive. As a prisoner, he met and befriended **Felix** and the two were rescued by Captain *McDeadguy* and the *Detachment*.
