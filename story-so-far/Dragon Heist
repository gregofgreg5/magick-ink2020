#Dragon Heist

## Chapter One
Our story begins as nine weary travellers and a raccoon have gathered at the ***Orc’s Boar Tavern** in the small hamlet of **Broken Road**. Broken Road, nestled near the base of the Sword Mountains, is a former smuggler’s lair and waystation for the settlement that would one day become the famous city of Waterdeep.

**Barraka, Borl, Erethil, Grunddle and his raccoon, Jarik, Luzeiros, Mon-k’ee, Sufari, and Vold** have traveled to this small, desolate tavern to meet with **Khal Greybeard**, a mountain dwarf and begin their new adventure. 

Hired away from their old lives, these nine (*ten?*) brave souls have contracted to form a guild, of sorts that will take on assignments from their benefactors. The nine agree to work out of Waterdeep and be available to complete missions as requested and also to become a source of information for their patrons. While their new job may sound mysterious, the 25 gold piece, monthly salary is enough to get them started, if not on a road to prosperity, if they add a little (expected) ingenuity along the way.

When they meet him, Greybeard is holding court in a small, disgusting (even worse than the rest of the bar) back room. He is accompanied by two hulking robed and hooded figures whose robes cover not only their faces but anything they might have in their hands). Curious, the party determines that these large figures are evil and an sniff or two from “Bandit” the trash panda, tells him that they are definitely not human.  Greybeard on the other hand, seems cordial and friendly, even enthusiastic to have the party on board.

To aid them, they are given their choice of an ornate piece of jewelry or accessory piece, whose center-piece is a stunning black opal. Greybeard tells them that the organization understands that this kind of work can be very rewarding, but is also very dangerous. He tells them that the jewelry won’t keep them from getting hurt, but might help keep them alive! And with that he sends them on their way to Waterdeep, where they are to make contact with one of the company’s agents in four nights.

The benefactor has arranged for the party to be temporarily lodged at the Traveler’s Boot, an inn not far from the Yawning Portal, where they are to meet their first contact. The night of their meeting, the Portal is packed with bar urchins. While most of Waterdeep is slowed by the cold and heavy snow, the Yawning Portal remains jumping.

Jubble Xeleon, a retired adventurer, of some renown in these parts, was the party’s first contact here in Waterdeep. While he had a storied career in this area once upon a time, he has spent the better part of two decades away, only returning recently. He tells the party that he has been working for their benefactor since he was new to the game, like they are. Jubble tells them that there used to be a network here, but they are gone.

The party will serve as the eyes, hear and sometimes hands and feet of the benefactor.It is important that they become part of the community of Waterdeep, to get to know the lay of the land and the way the city works, now. 

He shows the party his black opal signet ring and tells them to keep theirs with them. They will no others in the organization by the black opal, but more importantly it will keep them alive if they are not completely destroyed. The magic won’t last forever, but so long as you keep the opal with your body, there’s a chance that you can be healed. Even if you’re mostly dead. With that, he tells the party to find some adventure and that there’s no better place than here! And he leaves.

Chapter Two
The party decides to take Jubble at his word, despite some grumbling about the ambiguity of their job and the mysterious nature of their benefactor. The money’s good, so for their own reasons, they begin their careers in earnest.
