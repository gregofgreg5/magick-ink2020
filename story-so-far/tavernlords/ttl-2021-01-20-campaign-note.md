# Campaign Notes (January 20, 2021)

## Drow pirates, a wet polar bear and violence or *This is why we can't have nice things*

The battle raged on. With most of his crew out on *one last night on the town* before *Eyecatcher* sets sail for Neverwinter, Zord decided that it would be best to retreat for reinforcements. *After all, how much damage could these vagabonds do?*

The three gunfighters and two elite warriors were more than a handful. Barakka summoned his aura, emboldening his comrades. Borl dealt one of the warriors a [***Mind Spike***](http://dnd5ed.wikidot.com/spell:mind-spike) on his way to find Nim. While Jarik made the most of the Sinister knife, *viper*, even if he had to keep going to pick it up. *Maybe he needs a knife-retrieving weasel or something*... Still, Luzeiros' [***fog cloud***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fog-cloud) hampered both sides until he unleashed *the mighty thunderwave*!

The thunderwave was devastating, as usual, but this time no friendlies were caught in the blast and unfortunately none of the villains were taken down in the concussion. It was *Eyecatcher* that took the brunt of the damage. Luzieros smashed through a hole through the deck and smashed the base of the mast, dropping it on to the deck. Luzeiros nimbly (*you know for a guy his size*) avoided falling into the crater that he had created. And while the damage to the deck didn't seem significant at the time, we'll check back on that again later.

With the fog cloud dispersed, Ursulsa, Jarik and Barakka finally brought the warriors down. The gunsfighters were another story. Seeing the obvious danger, two of them turned their fire on Luzieros. The big lug was dropped in a barrage of gunfire. Jarik unleashed [***Chill Touch***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chill-touch) to no avail. Barakka *lay hands* Luzeiros, reviving him, and he promptly jumped right back into the fray. Ursula dispatched one of the gunfighters and Barakka finished the last of them.

### Below decks

With the danger abated, the party found Borl and Nim below deck where they were looking over some broken parts from Nim's creation. Let's call the creation, ***Min***. From the marks on the floor and it looked like Min had been severely beaten in this location. Nim's detector was spinning out of control, pointing towards the deck below, although he was too distracted by the pieces of his companion.

Ursula and Jarik investigated the rest of the hold and found it fully loaded, ready to travel.

The detector lead to Zord's locked cabin. As soon as Jarik picked the lock a [***Magic Mouth***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth) opened on the door and hollered *"By Lolth's teeth, have you no manners?"* Obviously some kind of alarm. Undeterred, the Tavernlords entered the room and stood shocked.

They found a lavish, decadent cabin with expensive-looking purple and pink lace draperies, tapestries and blankets adorning the room. In the center of the room stood a third nimblewright with a wooden rapier pointing at them and at its feet, the rest of the the broken Min.

Jarik channeled his *fey presence* and lulled the nimblewright with his charms. While he relaxed the construct, the rest of the team looked through the cabin. Their search came to an abrupt stop when the nimblewright held out a small, palm-sized green stone for Jarik. **The Stone of Golorr**!!

A huge relief and a new tension filled the room. The entire underworld of Waterdeep has been looking for this thing and now they have found it. On the other hand, the entire underworld of Waterdeep has been looking for this thing and now they have found it! Jarik dropped it securely into his back-up travel mug.

The team was about to decide to head back to the dock, when all of a sudden a green light filled the room. Everything drifted from purple to a light jade, glowing green. Paralyzed, all they could do is watch as the vision unfolded. Unclear even which parts were real and which were vision.

>**The vision**
>The party sees the stone hovering above them. It moves through the walls and ceilings of the ship. A halo-like glow rings the edge of the vision as the stone moves through the ship.
>
>Finally it moves quickly skyward, through the ship, hovering over 20 feet above the vessel. Suddenly, almost violently, it takes off, flying towards the horizon. It darts and dodges, finally coming to a stop in midair, then abruptly shoots down into the water.
>
>Like an arrow it dives for what seems like a long time until it nears the seafloor, spinning away from the collision at the last possible instant.
>Darting along, rising and cruising, spinning, the stone soared through the ocean. Again, with a sudden, neck-breaking turn it shot up towards the surface. However instead of breaking the plane of the water, it spun into a cavernous passage, emerging in a large underwater cave... full of gold.

"What we need is a submarine..." Luzeiros muttered. The party began planning, *head back*, *what about Marshoon, did he see that?*

The Other pulled on Luzeiros' arm and led him to a secret hatch in the room. The hatch led to a small, cramped room with another hatch on the floor. Luzeiros, Jarik and Borl jumped into the room. The big firbolg opened the hatch revealing the inside of a submarine! ***The Scarlet Marpenoth***!

Ursula is quick to point out that this was the ship that they had seen a model of back at the House of Inspired Hands. An actual freaking submarine.

The Tavernlords, already drunk with the idea that they could *commandeer* a submarine came across five rock gnomes, who were surprised to see them, but didn't really seem like they were oppositional. Seeing an opportunity, Barakka flexed his noble might and bribed them into submission. A 50 gp prize, per day was an outstanding bid and quickly snapped up. The party scrounged together all the monies that they had to pay the gnomes retainer.

A quick search of the ship, turned up four drow sailors who surrendered without a fuss. They were in no way prepared to confront a giant polar bear and a firbolg. Or the rest of them. 

After a brief discussion, Ursula swam to the  submarine hatch at the bottom of the *Eyecatcher*. Mammoth paws turned the valve, opening the lower chamber. As the water filled the small room, she floated gracefully to the inner hatch and tore that free, beginning the scuttling of the beautiful ship.

The polar bear swam out to the Scarlet Marpenoth and having retrieved it's frosty and wet saboteur, the vessel dove beneath the surface. Behind them, the breached the hull and deck began to splinter and then suddenly the deck in Zord's cabin burst and was flooded. Slowly *Eyecatcher* began to list gently to port as the Tavernlords, two (and a half) nimblewrights, five rock gnomes and a purloined submarine made for deep water.

* Did **Manshoon** (or anyone) else see the vision above the ship? 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*was there actually anything to see...?*

* Where did **Zardoz Zord** go and won't he be surprised when he gets back?

* Can they trust these rock gnomes? 

* Will they actually make it to Neverember's pilfered loot?

* All* this and more will be answered next time:

**February 3, 2021.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * *probably not **all**...*
