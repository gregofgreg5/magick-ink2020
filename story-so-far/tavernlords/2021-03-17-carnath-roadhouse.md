## The road to the Roadhouse (March 17, 2021)

Recovering from the battle, the Tavernlords decided to hold up overnight to rest and recover, in case they encountered more trouble on the road. Sufari, only needing four hours to recover, decided to scout ahead to try to unearth any danger. She traveled about thirty minutes and then waited, when it was safe, she'd move on again. Thirty minutes or so at a time.

It was about an mile or two away from Roadhouse, which she could see in the distance, when she saw a wagon over turned just inside the mere. She knew that the rest of the party couldn't be more than a few hours behind her, she considered going back for them. *But what if someone were injured over there*, and she looked around... the wagon was turned on it's side, about one hundred yards from the road. It was strange that she didn't see any wheel tracks from the road. *Strange, like it just lifted or was thrown over there, like by a giant*. Her blood still hot from the encounter with the giant the day before, she looked back at the road and then back at the wagon. She figured she could just go over there and check it out. What harm could there be?

She walked carefully to the wagon, checking out the ground between road and the wagon carefully as she went along, it seemed very odd that there were still no sign of the wagon from the road. Almost as if it were a...

### Trap!

Suddenly a volley of arrows came at her from the side of the wagon as two goblins appeared. One of the goblins drew back an arrow but pulled a muscle and the arrow flipped off of the bow. Despite the comedy, Sufari recognized the danger, she returned fire and killed one, but another appeared and fired an arrow into her. Another exchange of arrows, another dead goblin. The wounded one mustered his pride and charged her, swinging it's sword at her. She fired an arrow through it. 

It was then that the fourth goblin appeared, armored and more menacing, he tossed a *ball of yarn*...? at Sufari, it burst into a cloud of smoke and she grew a little weary. Sufari sized him up and took aim. Having dispatched two already, she was sure that she had loosed a fatal blow, but at the last second, the goblin captain *redirected the attack* and pulled his subordinate into the line of fire. The goblin captain threw another ball of yarn, which exploded in front of her, she lifted her bow, she went to lift the bow, but it was too heavy and then darkness.

### The wagon
About two hours later the rest of the Tavernlords arrived where the wagon lay just off the road. They debated whether to move on, assuming that if Sufari had encountered this or any trouble she would come back. They half-figured that she had already gone on to the Roadhouse. Valor getting the better of them, they decided to investigate the wagon. Erethil transformed into his panther-form, using his enhanced senses to track the battle. They discovered a swath of blood from one of the exploded goblins and what appeared to be something dragged, something like a *sack of potatoes*, towards the wagon. 

The wagon was deserted. There was a trail of footprints and what appeared to be the tracks of a small wagon or wheelbarrow leading off into the mere. Unfortunately, the tracks disappeared into the muck only a few dozen feet away from the wagon. With no other option, they abandoned Sufari, hoping that she'd be waiting for them at the Roadhouse and continued back down the High Road.

### Carnath Roadhouse
From the High Road, Carnath looks like a small fort, with a 20-foot wooden wall and outpost towers on the south-east and north-west corners of the structure. As promised, the doors were wide open. The Tavernlords ushed their wagons into the gate where they were greeted by the proprietor of the Roadhouse, Bog Luck.

The enormous half-orc, Luck was in his usual post, in the middle of the road, his arms out wide, in greeting. A warm, welcome, by all accounts. Even the towers appeared empty, only a few stable boys were on hand, ready to take the new arrival's horses and wagons. Luck arranged for the Tavernlords to board their horses and wagon and even put up their two escort troops to keep an eye on them, for as long as they liked.

Luck also told them that he would make sure that rooms were made up for them, like all travelers, they were encouraged to stay a night for free at the Roadhouse and enjoy the hospitality of the outpost's pub. An offer too hard to pass up.

### The Pub & the Stooges

Inside the pub they were greeted by Ardred Briferhew, Luck's defacto second-in-command and security chief. As Brieferhew was settling them into a table, Vold sized up the rest of the patrons, a male and female elf and a small dwarf behind the bar. But before they could sit down, the doors to the pub burst open and Luck and two dwarves entered, carrying an unconscious Sufari.

In a second, the whole pub was around Sufari. The dwarves were friends of the elves at the other table and they had found Sufari in the clutches of a few goblins. Traders and handymen by profession, the dwarves confessed that had there been more of them, they weren't sure that they would have been able to run them off. 

A combination of smelling salts and a nice hard slap roused Sufari. And while angry, she was otherwise unscathed for her adventure.

The rest of the evening was spent playing a dice game called ***[Bog's Luck](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/worlds-almanac/bogs-luck.md#bogs-luck)*** with their new friends: Laura and Moeh, the elves and Kehrle and Shep the dwarves. Hands for sale, more than swordsells, they were happy to try to help the Tavernlords solve the attacks on the High Road, which has been cutting into everyone's business around the Mere. They learned a lot from them and Briferhew about the lay of the land.

### Stuff they learned
**Dragons**. Once upon a time, in the way back when, the mere was the home of an ancient black dragon. There was a huge cult of lizard folk, dragonkind and dragon born that emerged around the dragon, including a few villages and an untold number of lairs. While *it is widely considered **fact** that the dragon was slain* and the cult disbanded, most of the *lairs* were ransacked and the villages grew smaller and smaller. Despite the ancient nature of this lead, there has been an increase in *lizard* activity in the past few years.

**The Sword of Leilon**. The crew had no love loss for what they called *the Leilon militia* and a bunch of thugs. They mostly stay in Leilon, but many are known to hire out as muscle to various unsavory elements around the Mere.

**Fat Cobra** Much to her own chagrin, Sufari uncovered Fat Cobra's band of goblins. Mostly considered *small time*, the legendary outlaw, Fat Cobra, recently emerged with a veritable goblin army. It is said that he controls a criminal empire that spans throughout the Mere all the way to Leilon. It's still difficult to tell whether Fat Cobra is a serious threat or a general nuisance.

**West Harbor** West Harbor is the most, longest, established civilized borough in the Mere. A large village on the coast, it has a small port and does modest trade in and around the Mere. It had been one of their most viable sources of work, but lately, whatever has stricken the Mere, whatever dark cloud seems to be rolling through has also settled on West Harbor as well.

**Illeforn Ruins Portal** When the Tavernlords asked their new friends about the strange *chaos elemental* that they encountered on the road, they were told that the unearthly metal grinding cataclysm of sound that they heard was reported near just about all of the caravan disappearances. Seldom mentioned, it is the one consistent report from the few surviving witnesses, who otherwise had little else to report, that this was generally discarded. They also told the Tavernlords that historically, within the Mere, the Illeforn Ruins were once a place of great power, where the portals there were powerful conduits to other locations. But like so much that had once been in the Mere, those were long dead and all that remained were the lifeless ruins.

They learned that the **Weeping Willow Inn** was owned and operated by *Lady Grace* and it was generally regarded as a *safe place*, not as safe as the Roadhouse, but the peace was kept there by Lady Grace's three massive half-orc hands that worked any number of jobs around the inn, including security. Kerhle and Laura offered to escort the Tavernlords to the Inn, for a small fee.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly and to no one's surprise, everyone learned not to play ***Bog's Luck*** with Grunddle, who cleaned out the house.

The adventure continues on **March 31** when the Tavernlords once again, hit the road...
