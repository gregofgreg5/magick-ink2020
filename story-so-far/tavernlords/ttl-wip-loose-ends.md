# Loose Ends (WDH Tavernlords)
Listed in order of appearance (more or less)

## Could Be Problematic
* **the Xanathar** The Xanathar have the Tavernlords pretty high on their *to do list*, but behind the Zhents and finding the stone.
    * The party killed a key operatives: [Captain El'Shimar](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/non-player-characters/captain-elshimar.md#captain-elshimar) and the mindflayer and intellect devourer
    * The Xanathar has put a bounty out on their heads
    * It's likely that, when they get around to it, more harassment in the form of firebombs or the such will likely be heading the Tavernlords way, if they don't get this taken care of
    * **Krentz** is still mad at the Tavernlords for interfering with their harassment of Yagra Stonefist. But he's pretty small fish in the Xanthar world



* **Crimson Sail** Very little is known so far about the Crimson Sail, other than that they travel in a sinister looking black ship with dark red sails. The wood appeared to be nothing that anyone had ever seen before. There have been rumors that they are pirates. *Listed as problematic because of their reputation, more than anything else*.
    * **Vanya** The party saw, more than met, her at the Skewered Dragon. She, along with a few of the Crimson Sail privateers, were meeting with Thaggus and co., at the Skewered Dragon.
    * **Arlen** Hanging back from the meeting with Thaggus, the more mature, stately half-elf privateer had been hanging back with one of Thaggus' mammoth hippotans for most of the event. Grunddle especially ingratiated himself to Arlen, who as they left invited the team to *come by the Crimson Sail with any information about Neverember's dragons that they might want to share*.


* **Civilar Girogi Blackspear** of the City Guard is not a fan. In general he thinks that the Tavernlords are more trouble than they are worth and at times thinks that they maybe complicit in some of the trouble that they appear to be *quelling*

* **Manshoon & the Zhentarim**
    * **Manshoon** is a mystery wrapped in a riddle bundled with a conundrum. Introduced as the leader of the Zhents, despite appearing ancient, he was intimidating with his presence and lunacy. Further investigation on Jarik's part, revealed that Manshoon was one of the original founders of the Zhentarim hundreds of years ago and was believed dead. In fact, having left a handful of clones behind, which lead to a brutal *clone war* of sorts, it appears that he's (or his progeny) have been killed a bunch of times. It is unclear whether the weird mage that they encountered is actually the original Manshoon or another clone. It was believed that all of his clones had been accounted for. Manshoon has an arrangement with the Tavernlords. In exchange for their lives, they have agreed to deliver Neverember's dragons to him. Counterpoint, if the Zhentarim find the dragons without them, he *promised* to give them a two day headstart before they hunted the Tavernlords down.
    * **Mr. Shadow** Little is known about this sinister and stealthy figure. He was first encountered kicking Erethil off a roof and then later appeared to be some kind of strange council for Manshoon. Concealed beneath a hood and cloak, it's not even clear what species this *Mr. Shadow* is.

* **Valetta**, Dragonborn cleric at the House of Inspired Hands, is more than a little bent out of shape with your behavior at Gond's temple. Expect a letter or some other formal form of complaint.

* **Zardon Zord** Owner/operator of the **Sea Maiden's Faire**, first impressions are that he's unlikely to add you to his ***Winterfair Card*** list.

## More Friend than Foe
* **Jubble Escalon** the team's first contact in Waterdeep. They had been sent to meet him by their mysterious benefactors/patrons (*Frontier*). He has turned up quite a bit between adventures, offering support and not-very useful information, and of late his arrival sent half of the team away on another *Frontier* mission.

* **Yagra Stonefist**, a half-orc mercenary that the soon-to-be Tavernlords rescued at the *Yawning Portal* from Krentz and some Zhents. She'll probably remember them, but most likely doesn't realize that the clods who saved her are the guys who re-furbished Trollskull Manor

* [**Volothamp Geddarm**](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volothamp_Geddarm), the famous author, who also gave the team their start in Waterdeep, hiring them to find Floon and repaying them with the deed to Trollskull Manor (some help from Renear Neverember).

* The ***Skewered Dragon***, a run down bar where the Tavernlords made some nice connections, thanks to Jarik.
    * Bruce, the bartender
    * Boris, the bouncer
    * Marion,  now *one of Jarik's lady friends*
    
* [**Floon Blagmar**](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Floon_Blagmaar) The casual lout who got himself captured by the *who was it who actually captured him again?* and started this whole mess. 

* [**Renear Neverember**](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Renaer_Neverember), was also rescued by the party while they were looking for Floon. In fact, Neverember had been the target of the kidnapping and Floon, a case of mistaken identity. An active member of the Harpers, he has tried to help the Tavernlords in anyway that he can. He also thinks that many (*not Borl*) of them would be a good fit for the Harpers and is always actively recruiting them. A fact that Barakka took full advantage of, to send his retainer **Jake** to apprentice with them. Neveremeber has even taken Jake under his wing, so to speak.


* **The Office of the Harbor Master**
    * **Chella**, is the most friendly with the Tavernlords. He and some of his various companions are regulars at the tavern.
    * **Cricket**, the *mousy human* auditor, is grateful for the party for rescuing Floon, whom he has a crush on
    * **Thaggus**, the Harbor Master has (so far) been pleased with the Tavernlords activities, as they relate to his dominion. He sees them as an asset and will support them

* The **Softsong & Fazzanach**: Sanamin and her brother Ordin Softsong, and Xanyas Fazzanch; the halfling youngsters who live and work at Manor

* **Guryon** Commander in the City Watch, a Captain in Force Grey
    * Guryon likes them a lot and has worked to keep the Tavernlords in good favor with the city authorities
* Barakka's retainers: **Emmett, Hannah, and Jake Silverado**
    * **Peyton Song of Tyr**, the cleric who arrived with Barakka's greatsword, MorningBlade and has taken up residence here at the *Hall of Justice* (Tyr's temple, not where the Justice League hangs out) in Waterdeep.

* **Barnibus Blastwind**, from Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors
    * His *support* is questionable, but he has taken the Tavernlords side with the city authorities; and he is grateful that they turned over the necklace of fireballs to him

* **Victor Trench**, the Trollskull Alley private investigator.
    * Trench has been a source of information
    * Trench set up the meeting with the Zhentarim
