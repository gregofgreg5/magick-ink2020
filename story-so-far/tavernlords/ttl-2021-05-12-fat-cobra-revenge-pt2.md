## Ambush redux

The horrific and bizarre cacaphony of sound heralded the arrival of the Chaos Elemental was like a bull smashing through an orchestra on the sensitive auditory senses of Erethil. Alerted, the Tavernlords were ready before the team of would-be-assassins arrived.

Vold started the melee by flanking their back line and letting lose his fiery breath. Grunddle followed with a [witch bolt](https://5e.tools/spells/witch-bolt-phb.html) cast at the strange, seemingly disconnected skeleton wearing weird armor, but it dodged the blast. But the surprisingly lithe creature could not avoid a volley of Sufari's arrows. Erethil, transformed into a Giant Toad a leaped into the fray, pummeling into and grappling Hi no shi no Zugaikotsu.

The two bullywugs began a valiant, but of course fruitless, assault on the mighty Vold. While *Chaunce* the wug squad leader, unsheathed his flaming scimitar and went after the humongous Erethil-toad. 

Vold went into a rage at the very suggestion that these tiny (not so tiny), slimy (very slimy) creatures would dare attack him and unleashed his fury, demolishing the first wug with his axe. Grunddle set forth an [illusonary blitz](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/homebrew/spells/illusory-blitz.md#illusory-blitz) of arrows on Chaunce. Sufari, showing him how it's done, finished the wug leader with her deadly aim.

Erethil-toad lashed out with his (icky) tongue and attempted to grapple the raptor who easily slipped the disgusting attack. Meanwhile, the last remaining wug went into a murderous frenzy, which turned out to be more annoying than "murderous" as Vold bore the brunt of the attack and then smartly cleaved the frogish-thing in two. 

The rest of the death squad dispatched (or consumed), the raptor fled, weaving around the dead bodies and standing Tavernlords and dove into the Chaos Elemental.

The danger dispatched, Erethil-toad urped-up the completely dis-assembled remains and equipment of Hi no shi no Zugaikotsu. His armor, sword and now-lifeless, fleshless bones clattered to the marsh floor to be rummaged through. Vold took the bizarre but strange armor. Erethil took Chaunce's flame tongue scimitar (because what he really needed was another *tongue attack*). And Grunddle took *Ikite iru*, the creature's sword that it never actually go the chance to deploy it against the Tavernlords.

As suddenly as it started, the battle was over. All that remained was the huge, flicking, glowing, flashing, luminescent form in the glade, continuing to make the terrible sounds, even if at a low murmur and not the torrential roar that the Tavernlords had come to be used to hearing around these things. 

*This thing? Was there more than one? Was this the same one that they dispatched on the High Road? It was impossible to tell...*

## Friend or foe?
Because they can't help themselves, Grunddle began to try to make friends with the *mysterious* elemental. He made all the right *friend not foe* actions that one would make with a wild animal. The chaos elemental responded, it's hectic motion and wild changing of colors slowed, maybe even paused and pulsed...*attentively*. 

The rest of the Tavernlords waited patiently, scheming. Vold and Erethil had already hatched a plan to follow the raptor into the elemental. After all they had already seen the party from the High Road push a wagon into the elemental and escape them. And they saw the killer squad emerge from (*around?*) it.

After a few minutes, with patience wearing thin, Grunddle conceded that he wasn't getting the results he had hoped for, but to his credit, at least the creature wasn't attacking them. A brief plan was developed and then Vold, in his new armor and the Trollskull Mimic in his customary station on the dragonborn's back, climbed on the back of the giant Erethil-toad and the three of them leaped into the chaos elemental.

## The Fall of the Weeping Willow

Erethil-Toad and Vold emerged from the elemental in front of the Weeping Willow Inn. It was mid-morning when they charged into the shimmering, loud, crazy explosion of light, color and sound. When they emerged at the Inn, it was night. 

In the road before them was one of the Inn's *protector Orc's*, Chick the trio's leader, was splayed dead on the ground. In the area, even over the roar of the elemental, Erethil could hear clear sounds of goblinoids. 

Erethil and Vold saw at least two goblins and menacing the door was an ogre. Vold signaled to the rest of the team as they emerged from the elemental.

Enthusiastically, Sufari lead off with an arrow into the ogre. One of the goblins returned fire and dug an arrow into Sufari. Erethil cast [moonbeam](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Moonbeam#content) and an agonizing, blazing light seared into the ogre. Enraged the ogre closed on Sufari and smashed her with his club.

The mimic reached out and struck the first goblin. A second goblin popped out and fired an arrow at Vold, who deftly missed it. Sufari stepped away to create space to fire again and the ogre clubbed her again. She spun and fired another arrow into the ogre. The ogre continued pounding on her as Grunddle's flying monkey came over to render aid to Sufari's attacks.

A third goblin emerged and attacked Vold with a scimitar, but missed. The first goblin closed again and continued it's attack on Sufari, cutting into her with his scimtar. 

The mimic missed a bite attack and Vold flew into a rage and attacked one of the goblins, but missed in his fury. The goblin lashed out and tore into Vold. 

The ogre smashed Sufari with his club again, she staggered, taking a massive amount of damage in this battle. She slid back again to get aim and was again hit by the club. The blow threw her aim off and her arrow flew right into the mimic!

Vold swore indignantly at her, raising his axe over his his head screaming in rage and anger.

Grunddle unleashed the sword he picked up earlier from Hi no shi no Zugaikotsu, speaking a command word, the sword flew from his hands and attacked the ogre. And Grunddle also fired off a volley of *illusory blitz* arrows and felled the ogre that had been plaguing Sufari.

Erethil moved his *moonbeam* from the fallen ogre to one of the goblins, who exploded beneath it's searing gaze. 

Vold, still enraged that his friend had taken an arrow, swung his great battleaxe over his head and in a roundhouse motion cleaved one of the remaining goblins just above both knees. The gob's eyes in shock, falling backwards, away from his legs!

Sufari let loose another arrow, at the remaining goblin. The goblin continued, Grunddle let fly an *illusory blitz* of more arrows, but the goblin kept coming. In a blind fury, having just watched his brother cleaved in three by Vold, the goblin launched himself at the dragonborn, flailing his scimitar. As earnest as it was, the attack barely wounded Vold. From behind him, the mimic lunged out it's terrible maw and delivered the final blow, chomping into the last goblin.

## Aftermath

With the immediately threat apparently dispatched, the team looked around and could detect no further danger. Vold went to kick in the front door, but it was already smashed in. Inside they saw another dead orc, *Lev*, lay dead in the middle of the room. Around the room they saw two more goblins, a strangely armored kenku, a similarly armored skeleton and standing in the back of the room was Harry Stamph, the son of the Lady Grace, the Inn's proprietor. He was shouting up the stairs...
>You can't hide forever mother! We've killed all of your babysitting orcs! Is that stinking gnome still alive up there? We're coming mother! You can't stop us! No one can!!!
