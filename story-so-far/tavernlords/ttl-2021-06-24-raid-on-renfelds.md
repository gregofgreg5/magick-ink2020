# Raid on Renfeld Manor
1493-01-18 (two days after they began to look for the missing halfling, Xanas)

In the morning, Luzieros and Jarik rounded-up Ursula and Barakka and set out to look at a property that Jarik had found near the southern-end of docks. When they arrived Barakka could immediately see why the price was so attractive, the price was the only attractive thing about building that was once, at best, a dive-bar. Unoccupied and barely standing on it's own, Ursula opted to wait outside while the others went in cautiously with the landlord.

They weren't in the dump for more than a few minutes when Urusula summoned them. Just down the road she spied Captain Guryon and a three of his City Watch standing in front of what appeared to be an old inn. Like the bar they were inspecting, it too had seen better days.

Luzieros led the team over to Guryon, curious and willing to offer aid to their friend. Guryon, seemed pleased to see the Tavernlords, told them that the Watch had received an anonymous report that there had been *suspicious activity* at this *flop house*. Ordinarily such a thing would be dismissed, but Guryon had a feeling about this one.

Jarik grinned as he passed by the sign, barely hanging on a broken post that read "***Renfeld Manor***".

Guryon, his three Watchmen and the Tavernlords breached the front door.The proprietor, a disheveled man named *Jon* put up little protest as they moved through and rounded up everyone on the property. They found three other men, all named *Jon*. Two of them were found performing some sort of ritual. The other was writing out strange pamphlets.

The pamphlets had some kind of cryptic riddle. Ursula *pocketed* one of them.

The others were performing some kind naming ceremony on some random cutlery. They rattled off about a dozen names, some of them even recognizable: dark deities, strange gods and would-be greater powers.

Guryon or one of his team recognized two of the *Jons* as having open warrants or being criminals at large. They decided that they didn't like anything that's going on here and that they were going to take the whole lot of these clowns in for questioning or imprisonment for the good of the city. 

The Tavernlords helped search the *house*, which may have once been a decent boarding house, but was barely holding itself together now. 

Rummaging through one of the rooms, a room no different than any of the others, Jarik found a hidden space between the floorboards. In the space, he found a bag with the unmistakable remains of a nimblewright... their friend *Min*. The last the Tavernlords knew, Min was on a mission with Nim...

Looks like the hunt for another taproom would have to wait.
