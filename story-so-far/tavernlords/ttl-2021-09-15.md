# Where We At and How We Got Here
* 1492 Nightall 18 Jubble Excelon sent Erethil, Sufari, Vold and Grunddle to Waterdeep's Magister Kylynne Silmerhelve who gave them the mission to find out who is raiding caravans on the High Road and stop them.
* Their first encounter was some goblins, an ogre, and a mysterious cloaked figure that used *what we'll call a **chaos elemental*** to travel. They were able to steal a wagon right under their noses!
* Sufari was subdued by goblins and a ball of yarn.
* Their next stop was the Carnath Roadhouse where they met Bog Luck and the Stooges. 
* Kehrle and Laura escorted the Tavernlords to The Weeping Willow Inn where they met Lady Grace, Rockhound, the three Ogres and **AJ Frost**.
* They also encountered **Eklas Kisri**, an adept from the Diegesis Academy in Westgate, who had been sent to recover three invaluable tomes.
* The tomes and the jewel that they found was taken when Kisri and her escorts were attacked. She offered the Tavernords a huge reward for returning the tomes.
* For a cut of their reward, AJ Frost led the Tavernlords to a known den of the notorious crime lord, Fat Cobra.
* Frost led them right into an ambush, which the Tavernlords sussed out and ambushed in their own right.
* After clearing out the den, they did find one of the tomes.
* Exiting the den they found themselves in the midst of another ambush, this one they just fought through.
* There was nary a time to rest before Hi-no shi no Zugaikotsu and a team showed up, traveling via a *chaos elemental*.

* A clawfoot raptor who was with the villains escaped back through the chaos elemental.
* Through the chaos elemental they could see that the Weeping Willow Inn was apparently under siege!
* Vold, riding the Erethil-Giant Toad, lead the team into battle, dispatching the bandits outside.
* Before they entered the building, they met Taklak and Stupid, who had taken out the raptor.
* The Tavernlords, behind Vold's *black tentacles*, defeated the invaders. It turned out that Harry Stamph, the son of owner, had formed an alliance with these scoundrels and had killed his mother and just about everyone else before they stopped him.
* Before they could make much more than sense of it than that, a battalion of the Sword oF Leilon arrived and took the Tavernlords in to *light custody*.
* Except for Erethil, who wildshaped into a warhorse and was brought along with the rest of the bodies and gear.
* Also in their *custody* (shackled at least) was their old friend, the duplicitous, AJ Frost.
* At the Admiral's Foot, a historic site in the Mere, they were introduced to the Preator of West Harbor, Westley Whitehall. The Preator was adviser to the Steward of West Harbor.
* Whitehall turned out to be none other than **Fat Cobra!!!***

* The Tavernlords were taken to the prison beneath the compound and locked away.
* In the prison, they met **Tal**, the legendary Diegesis adept whose tomes that Kisri had recovered in Leilon.
* Almost 100 years ago, Tal and her mentor, **Einric** were investigating a connection between several landmarks in the Mere when they opened a portal and were taken prisoner. For Tal, that was about two days ago.

* Grunddle came up with a 31-step plan that had the team freed by *about* the 15th step.
* The Tavernlords discovered Soluun Xibrindas, a drow who claimed to be a highly placed member of the Bregan D'aerthe from Waterdeep, and a labyrinth of crystal chambers that held *what looked like* replicas of some very familiar people.

* Escaping the prison, they sent Soluun back to Waterdeep with a message magicked on to his back, warning the authorities and other Tavernlords.
* Meanwhile they returned to the Admiral's Foot, to retrieve Erethil and Taklak (and Stupid) as well as their gear.
* Vold and the Trollskull Mimic came up with a plan. Everyone pretty much disregarded it and began to lay siege to the compound.
* The mimic went in after their gear.
* Grunddle and *Bandit* set fire to the stables.
* Meanwhile, Erethil had joined a team of Diegesis adepts who were also trying to escape the compound.
* All heck broke loose when a gargantuan creature, clearly from another plane, burst through an enormous chaos elemental

* It took a concerted effort from the combined Tavernlord and Diegesis team to defeat the horrific creature.
* In it's wake, a much smaller chaos elemental remained, but the real problem was...
* AJ Frost had assembled a squadron of villains to deal with the Tavernlords.
* Vold was incensed, leaping off a four-story ledge to go after Frost, and landing *pretty much* in the middle of the rest of the bad guys.
* Erethil wild-shaped into a quickling and dashed around the compound to engage Frost and his men.
* On Stupid, Taklak charged around the compound with Erethil.
* Sufari was having a field-day firing arrows at Frost from across the compound.
* Shiluo engaged the menacing figure with mighty hammer, but shortly found his arm turned to stone!
* Taklak charged towards Frost and then abruptly leaped off the side of the walkway, plummeting four-stories! Grinning, thinking he was going to deliver Frost to the Mighty Vold, he cast *lightning lure* on him and dragged him over the edge with him.
* Taklak landed... bounced off the roof a floor below. Frost smashed, dead on the ground.
* Leaving the Tavernlords with only a small handful of villains left to deal with. Chiefly among them, this guy...

**Open wounds:**
* It looks like the bullwugs (and batrachi) are responsible for the trouble on the High Road
* ...and that they are about to (or already have) re-awakened the terrible diety, Ramenos.
* There are all those crystal chambers and the ones that were already open...
* Clearly there's something wrong in West Harbor.
* And it doesn't look like things are going the right way in Leilon, if the presence of *The Sword* in all this is any indication.
