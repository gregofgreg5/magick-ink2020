## On the road
On their trek, the Tavernlords found themselves surrounded by 24 Swords of Lellon, including a handful carrying some of the biggest shields that they'd ever seen, and their prisoner, AJ Frost. Not long into the journey, Frost turns and asks Sufari and/or Vold, whether or not they still had that crazy lady's book? When, at first they don't answer, he continues to ask, mockingly and with some ridicule.

Grunddle figures that his asking if they still have it implies that he knows about the fight in the mere, knows that we searched/ransacked/looted the lair, and knows the book was there for us to take. That's a whole lot of intimate knowledge of the bad guys. Grunddle gives him the stink eye. He considers creating an illusory smell on Frost if he could get away with it. Taklak ignored Frost because he's not a dragon. 

Vold finally replied, "Crazy lady's book? It seems to me that any information you give us is always wrong. There was no book and there was no way back to the Inn without a miraculous bit of help. Thanks for nothing AJ."

Sufari did not verbally engage with Frost. He just received a stare that should have made him very uncomfortable and made him feel the need to sleep with one eye open, if he had any sense of self-preservation or thought that there was any way that the Tavernlords could get to him. Sufari just kept her own counsel.

AJ smirked at Vold, "I guess you were more successful finding your way back than you were getting the prize you were after. Maybe you guys should have stayed home and sloshing mead." He snickered and grinned, "Children can navigate these lands, I assumed you'd find your way." He winked at Vold. "By they way, that's a fine weapon you have there. I had a good friend who used to have one just like it." His countenance grew stone cold as he nodded towards Vold's armblade.

Vold replied with a wink... "He and his friends allowed me to take it without much of a fuss."

Frost snarled and said, "surely not all of his friends..." while glaring as menacingly a man with his hands tied in front of him could glare.

"Shut up both of you." Dunchell, the Sword Captain snapped at the lot of them.

Vold waited for a good moment and whispers "All of the ones that didn't run." He'll remain quiet after that.

Frost just muttered something under his breath that might have been: "We'll see who runs..."

The journey in total took three days, with very well guarded encampments set up. While they were made to be *comfortable*, they were beginning to feel more and more like prisoners than guests.

## The Preator of West Harbor
The caravan arrives at a compound a few hours from West Harbor. The compound looks like a small fort.

Sword Captain Dunchell greeted a group of half-orcs and goblins. Dunchell informed the Tavernlords that they would be waiting here for Wesley Whitetail, the Preator of West Harbor, the Steward's *closet adviser*. 

About an hour later, just before dusk, a cadre of three kobolds, Doragon’naito, and a hooded figure arrived. It was a strange group, and it was impossible to take their eyes off of Doragon’naito. The winged creature stood over seven feet tall, towering over the hooded dwarf that he accompanied.

Wesley Whitetail stepped forward and lowered his hood, revealing the unmistakeable markings of the crimelord, ***Fat Cobra**!

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fat-cobra-framed.jpg?raw=true)

Fat Cobra addressed Captain Dunschell and immediately ordered him to remove the *ridiculous* shackles from AJ Frost. Suddenly the tone of all the men changed as Frost was freed.

Fat Cobra: These are the ones responsible for the raids on the Weeping Willow and Carnath Roadhouse?

Frost nodded with a lupine grin and walked over to Vold and crashed his fist into the mighty dragonborn's face. He explained that these are the ones causing trouble for the Zhents in Waterdeep.

>Fat Cobra: They don’t look like much
>
>Frost: They killed one of my best… acquantainces.
>
>Fat Cobra: And these are the ones you had Waterdeep send to investigate the Wugs insane High Road chaos shenanigans?
>
>Frost nodded.
>
>Fat Cobra: And now?
>
>Frost: The Zhentarim… has made some other arrangements with their friends back in Waterdeep. I need them alive, to make sure they stay in line.
>
>Fat Cobra: Put them in prison. I don’t want any trouble with them. If they get out of line, my men will kill them.

Captain Dunshell ordered the Tavernlords to surrender their weapons, armor and any magic and put it on the back of the wagon being drawn by their *warhorse*.

Of course, the two Tavernlords that had gone unaccounted for were back there: Erethil in the *Wild Shape* of a warhorse and the Trollskull Mimic, lying on top of the recovered book.

One by one the Tavernlords head to the wagon, under the supervision of at least two Swords of Leilon, to remove their equipment: Grunddle, Sufari, Vold... when they get to Vold, he holds up his hands, showing the bracer and tells them that it cannot be removed. Frost says, of course it can, that Vold had taken it from a friend of his. He tells Vold that he can either take it off or Frost will remove it from his corpse. Pretty sure it wasn't going to come off, Vold meant to make a mocking show of it, fidgeting with the clasps, when suddently it popped open and fell into his hand. Playing it off like he meant to do that, with his best *feline grin*, Vold dropped the bracer into Frost's hands. Taklak glared at Frost as he watched past him, he and Stupid marched back to the back of the wagon and then bent over as if to take something off and suddenly began to dig!

Before anyone could do anything about it, Taklak and his giant weasel leapt into the ground and tunnelled away. The Sword were astonished, perplexed and had to fight back a laugh. All of that humor dried up when Fat Cobra walked over to the mound of fresh dirt. He kicked at it gently and shook his head. 

And with that the Tavernlords were *unarmed, unarmored and captured*. Of course they didn't think to take Grunddle's *tattered and old* robe, which had changed it's appearance sometime between their initial apprehension and their inevitable arrest here at the compound. AJ Frost and the Sword escorted them into the compound. Most of the Sword waited outside of the walls, while a small group brought them to almost the middle of the yard. Another group of Sword took Erethil (warhorse) and the wagon of goods over to the stables.

The Tavernlords were brought to a group of four half-orcs, huge muscles and bare-chested, the half-orc used some tools to unlatch two contraptions on each side a large (10x10 foot) square in the ground. Then it took all four of them and all of their strength to lift a giant slab on a hinge, revealing a stairway into the compound's prison.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fc-prison-escape-start.JPG?raw=true)

The prison had to be at least 30 feet underground. It was cold and dark, there was absolutely no light, the guards and their bosses being half-orcs and goblins, they didn't need light to see in the dark. There were at least four of them, they moved around a lot as the outside guards brought the Tavernlords down into the prison, making it more difficult to count their number.

The Tavernlords were escorted to their cells, which were 15x20 foot rooms with steel bars to keep them penned in. All together there were eight cells, four on each side. The prisoners were spaced so that they were not directly facing one another. To his surprise, Vold (because the belt he still wore endowed him with darkvision!) saw another prisoner in the cell at the end of the row.

## Tal
Trapped in one of the cells furthest from the entry, a lone female elf sat imprisoned, waiting for the rest of her story to begin.

Once the Tavernlords were escorted into their cells, Tal rose and began to take measure of them. She could see the mighty dragonborn across from her and her senses told her that there were at least two more of them in the other cells. 

> Tal [Sylvan: translation] **Are any of you friends that can understand me?**

The Tavernlords who had been moping and grumbling, uhm, planning and scheming fell suddenly silent.

While the others plotted... something Grunddle couldn't understand, he began to lay the groundwork for his escape. He paced his cell, stopping at each corner for a few moments, sometimes standing still, sometimes lying down and getting back up. When he neared his door, he cast [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/prestidigitation) to create illusory sounds in the hallway - dripping water, creaking stone and wood, animal skittering, etc. *A nice cover for action.*

Despite only being in a slightly better predicament than a few moments ago, Tal smiled, an experienced adventurer, she recognized that her fortunes had turned. And from their conversation, their banter amongst themselves and the bloodied but formidable appearance of the dragonborn in the cell across from her, she was beginning to think that she was going to like these *new friends*. She was also fairly certain, from their confidence and demeanor that this was not their first time in such a *predicment*. Indeed, she was feeling a lot better about her fortunes.

A warrior by trade, *a student of Knowledge* by profession, she was many things, but a monk? She grinned, perhaps she had been spending too much time with the monks and scholars at one Academy or another, before she and Einrich started out on this latest adventure. Still she couldn't help but be amused, thinking how Einrich would laugh out loud at her being mistaken for a monk.

*Understood, perhaps*, but only Grunddle, who was too busy to acknowledge the comment to reply, connected her comment with the legendary ***Diegesis Academy***. In his own studies, he had heard and even read some of the work that referenced information from the Diegesis, but he had never been to one of their actual Libraries and to his knowledge had never met one of their missionaries.

As one of the goblin guards passed by Vold's cage, and started ranting at him to shut-up, Vold made like he had to sneeze and then launched a blob of fiery mucous at the goblin. The guard threw it's hands up in the air and danced around like a jester, screeching in goblin at Vold as the flaming boogers passed over it's head. Vold just laughed as the goblin crashed the handle-end of it's scimitar against the cage. 
DM: Fiery snot
> Grunddle [Gnomish: translation] **I can get to the elf or the dragon without being seen, once I get out.**
> *[understood by: Grunddle, Tal]*

Vold lashed out at the goblin, trying to grab it through the cage. The savy goblin stepped back out of the way and spat at the floor between him and the dragonborn.

> Tal [Elvish: translation] **Yes, that would be wise.**

> 
>  Vold Orcsbane [Elvish: translation] **Indeed, if there are enemies in a straight line, do not get in that line.**
> *[understood by:  Vold Orcsbane, Sufari,  Erethil Naïlo, Tal]*

The goblin went over to stare at Tal and drifted dangerously close to Vold's cage. The dragonborn threw another punch through the bars, just missing the creature again. Vold grinned wildly at the universe.

>Tal [Elvish: translation]**Yes, I'm familiar with dragons and their kin.**
> *[understood by:  Vold Orcsbane, Sufari,  Erethil Naïlo, Tal]*

The goblin mocked Vold and he spewed another fiery snot and then a punch. His grin turning more fierce and angry.

Meanwhile, in his cell, Grunddle lay down and cast an [minor illsion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion) of himself, lying on the floor. Then cast [reduce/enlarge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Enlarge%20Reduce#content) on himself, shrinking to much less continable size. He snuck over to the corner of his cage and peered out. He watched as the goblin taunting Vold started walking back towards him and the front of the prison. Grunddle waved his hands and cast [dancing lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dancing-lights) with material components pinched from one his Mage Robe's pockets. Suddenly the hallway lit up with a blinding light, piercing through the darkness. 

Using the moment after, as the creatures with darkvision re-adjusted to the darkness, Grunddle slipped through his bars and ran down the corridor to Vold's cell.

The goblin, dazed by the lights staggered back towards Vold. Hollering at him in goblin, blaming him for the fireworks.

Gunddle stepped behind the mighty dragonborn. Across the aisle, in the cell to the right, Tal saw what was coming and even though her cell wasn't exactly in the line of fire, she moved over to the other side, just in case.

Vold just grinned again and cut loose with his fiery breath. The burst of fire tore through the cage, ripping the bars into shred and send the goblin staggered back, smashing it into the cage across from Vold, just about exploding aginst the bars.

reddit: u/Bone_Merch

In her cell, seeing the opportunity arise, Tal summoned her *bonded weapon*... a deadly double-bladed scimitar, a weapon of an elvish nation from a far off-land. 

Vold peeked his head down the corridor, seeing the other guards starting to come to attention and preparing themselves.

The battle was about to be joined.
The escape was about to be begin...

**To be continued**
