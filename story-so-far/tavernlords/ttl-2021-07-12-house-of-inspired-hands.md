# The House of Inspired Hands

Shortly after the Tavernlords returned from Aurinax's cavern, Luzeiros had begun making *amends* for their first venture over the the House of Inspired Hands. *Hat in hand* Luzeiros went to meet with Valetta, the priestess that they had offended. As is their way, she welcomed the noble firbolg. She didn't exactly *roll her eyes* when he offered to repair the damage that the Tavernlords had caused, but she casually dismissed the notion, over her tea, explaining that they already had that *covered* (the damage was to the roof, if you recall). But she clearly appreciated the offer.

Luzeiros went on to explain that the Tavernlords had grown fond of Nim and that he would like to petition her for his release into their custody. She admitted that the majoirty of the residents and practitioners at the House of Inspired Hands thought of him more of a nuisance than... well, than anything else really. Though, she insisted that he would be missed, he provided some service and was a good *subject* for novice teachers to practice teaching new skills. In fact, she admitted that he was perfect for that, as he often quickly forgot whatever he was taught, making him ready to *learn it again*.

Valetta told Luzeiros to come back the next day for tea, and they would discuss the matter again. This went on for four straight days. Luzeiros was beginning to think that she was exacting payment out on him, out of his time in some sort of sick sadistic way. But, while at first he wasn't even sure she liked him, he was actually growing fond of their conversations.

A priest himself, he was no stranger to the subtle workings of the clergy or those of a monastic bend. In fact, he was beginning to think of the House as a monastery as much as it was a temple. Personally, he didn't have much use for this *Gond fella*, but he began to admire the way that the parishioners did their work and studies. And he had already begun to appreciate the old dragonborn, Valetta - her straight-forward, blunt way about her and even her short temper.

Most importantly it didn't feel like she was just after what he knew. She willingly shared information and answered his questions, albeit sometimes vaguely, which was to be fair his response sometimes too. He learned that Nim had been at the House for over a hundred years, created he was believed to be created by one of the most famous craftsmen to ever take up residence here: a gnome craftsman (possibly an artificer?) named Sharrman, who also died over a century ago. 

She was keenly interested in their involvement, *if any* in the sinking of *Eyecatcher*. She played it off as the ship being of extraordinary beauty, which Luzeiros thought was sincere. But that afternoon as he was leaving, he strolled through the *Hall of Wonders* and saw the miniature of of the *Scarlet Maripenoth* on display. Suddenly his assessment of her sincerity became suspicion... *did she know that the submarine was moored to the ship?!?*

Luzeiros also learned that one of the Tavernlords, Grunddle had been studying with one of their craftsmen. 

While they never came to any formal agreement regarding Nim, when Luzeiros saw what Nim had in mind, he figured it was as good of time to test this *new friendship* as any.
