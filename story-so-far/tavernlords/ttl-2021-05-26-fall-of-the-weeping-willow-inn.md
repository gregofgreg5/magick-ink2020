# Fall of the Weeping Willow Inn

## *Here There Be Dragons*
>
>After dispatching the ogre and goblins, the Tavernlords decided they should try to get a better idea about what’s going on inside the inn before charging in and fighting whatever they found. (It’s called “growth,” team). The cautiously approached the building - Vold from the West, Sufari from the East, Grunddle and Erethil from the South - and peered in a window. Bandit was standing on Grunddle’s shoulders in order to see and the mimic had to lick a corner of the glass in order to gain a peephole.
>
>So focused were they on the interior of the inn, nobody noticed a clever girl stalking Vold from the swampy underbrush. The velociraptor witnessed the carnage at the front of the inn, but thought it could take one of the adventurers now that he was alone and preoccupied. Muscles taut, eyes forward, she made the decision to strike, took two lunging steps towards Vold when…
>
>“HIYAAAA! DRAGON LEAP!”
>
>Vold whipped around to see a startled velociraptor (the creature he and Erethil had followed through the elemental/portal then immediately forgot about) being landed upon and attacked by what appeared to be a giant weasel and a Cookware Golem&trade;. He was half right.
>
>There was a flurry of faintly glowing frypans that both stabbed the raptor’s back and neck while protecting the attacker from retaliation. The weasel bit at both ankles, bringing the surprised  beast to the ground. A second set of blows and bites finished off the dinosaur before it even had a chance to react. Panting and slightly bloody from the fight, the “golem” stood up and revealed itself to be a kobold wearing armor made from, yes, cookware and shovels and discarded pieces of metal one might find at a blacksmith or repair shop.

>“Great Dragon! I am Taklak.” The little kobold bowed grandly. “This is Stupid.” He paused, staring up at a confused Vold, then looked around and gestured back at the giant weasel who was cleaning itself, currently upside down and folded in half to better get the back left foot into its mouth. 
>
>“That weasel is with you?”
>
>“Yes. I am with Stupid.”
>
>Vold shook his head, bronze mullet glinting in the sun. “Why are you here? Why did you protect me?”
>
>“‘Protect’ you?!? Oh no! Tiny Taklak was not protecting. Great dragons not need protection. Taklak been waiting for Mighty Vold to return to barn so Taklak may ask a… a… great boon!” He was visibly pleased with himself for coming up with those words.
>
>“Taklak is small. Weasel is stupid. But Taklak is SPECIAL! Taklak can make things and Taklak can fight. Stupid is fierce fighter, too.” He began to fidget. “Taklak’s old clan pushed him out of caves. But they never see dragons, only talk about them. They never see one fight, see one breath fire!”
>
>The kobold closed his eyes, took a deep breath. “Please allow Taklak and Stupid to follow you, Great Dragon, and learn from you, and bask in your immense dragon power, and aid you in any small way Taklak can. Taklak not need treasure, stay out of your way, but…”
>
>The odd creature had fallen to its knees

## Assualt on the Weeping Willow Inn

After *embracing* their new companion, the Tavernlords continued to quickly scout out the hostile environment. They cleared out the entire area around the inn and checked in whatever windows that they could see in. They were able to see another dead orc, two goblins, two strange characters and Harry Stamph, the son of Grace, the owner of the Inn. Harry was shouting up the stairs, threatening his mother.

A few plans were discussed, Vold and Erethil were ready to charge in the front door. Taklak was ready to go where Vold was going to go. Grunndle and Sufari went around back and came back with another plan. Grunndle suggested that they try to get at least some of them upstairs and surprise the intruders. A brief discussion and a plan was hatched.

Vold, Taklak and Stupid were going to go through the front. Vold had a plan for a distraction. Sufari was going to wait at the windows, for Vold's distraction and take advantage of the distance between her and the villains. Grunddle and Giant-spider Erethil were going to ascend to the second floor and surprise the invaders from *the high ground*. 

The stealth assault team made their way into the building and into one of their rooms. As they sneaked into the hall, the found *Bear*, the last orc, bloodied and barely standing. Clearly guarding the door behind him. Grateful to see Grunddle and assuming that the flying monkey and the spider was *with him*, he let the two look into the room. Rockhound was covered in blood, obviously near death, clutching his small, well-worn axe in both hands, down on one knee before the fallen body of his old friend. Lady Grace, looked, *well more dead than alive* to Grunddle and Erethi-Spider. Grunddle motioned that the three of them were going to go downstairs. Bear nodded, relieved and leaned against the wall, sighing. *He didn't look very good either*.

Vold and company launched the frontal assault. Taklak (and Stupid) crashed through the window and attacked the seige goblin. The mimic lashed out with it's pseudopod, snapping it's scrawny neck, and pulling it back to it's hungry maw. A satisfying bonecrunching crack resonated through the room, the Trollskull Tavernlords announcing their presence loud and clear! 

Vold, with a sinister grin, watched his new minion leap into the fray and unleashed the [*Black Tentacles*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Black%20Tentacles#content_) trapped in his *armband morningstar*. The spiked-balls at the end of the chains whirled out in front of him, and he could feel the power coursing through him, the darkness kindling his own fire, his rage growing as the spell began take effect. In back of the room near the stairs, the area darkened, as if a dark shadow had fallen over just that part of the room. Suddenly thick, dark, black tentacles swarmed everyone and everything in the area, smashing tables and chairs, reaching out and grabbing the remaining goblin, Ken ga ō sugiru and Harry Stamph!


Stupid raced into battle striking out at the remaining goblin, but his bite glanced off the creature's armor. 
Sufari let fly an arrow and... missed catastrophically. The strange kenku, leaned forward and let loose a wildly loud caw, then straightened up and tossed it's katana up into the air in front of hit. It leaned forward again and cawed and the sword flew towards Sufari like a spear, slamming into and pushing her back, before flying back to hover and Shadoukenku. 

Almost immediately the tentacles reached out for the Shadoukenku who swiftly dodged them. Vold strode into the carnage, walked purposefully into his well-chosen spot, shrugged his shoulders, shook out his mane and let loose his fearsome fire on the goblin and Shadoukenku. 

The tentacles wrapped tighter on Stamph as he struggled to free himself. As he screamed out in pain and frustration, he could hear Vold's mighty laugh over the din of the combat. Ken ga ō sugiru, a much larger and scarier looking target shrugged and tried to push out of the tentacles, but failed and they grew tighter, crushing the undead creature. His dark eye sockets glared hollowly at Vold, emotionless but somehow drenched in anger.

Two more goblins came into the fray from around the bar. The third goblin pulled out his short bow and let an arrow fly, digging into Vold. A second tentacle wrapped around the first goblin, the two tentacles squeezing and crushing the creature, popping it like a spoiled melon. And the mighty Vold's laughter roared through the room.

The last goblin fired at Vold missing terribly.

Erethil, who since coming through the elemental, felt different and could sense some other strange branches off of his *wild shape tree*. Some very different options. With a twinkle in his eye, he shifted into a [Gray Ooze](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gray-ooze)!

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/grey-ooze.png?raw=true)

The Ere-Ooze sloshed down the stairs and lashed out with it's psuedopod, striking Stamph burning him with acid, spewing all over him. Stamph shrieked as the acid burned him and he began to boil into unconsciousness.

Grunndle leapt over the rail of the stairway and cast [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/feather-fall). Bandit, the flying monkey soared through the stairwell and grabbed his *master* and droppped im on the other side of the Ere-Ooze.

Taklak, used his nimble feat to dash across the room and let loose a flurry of strikes with is infused lantern shields. Stupid followed his master into combat also striking at the goblin. 

Vold smashed his morning star into Shaduokenku, knocking it back into the darkness. The kenku adeptly stepped out of the way of the tentacles again. It cawed at Vold and lashed out with *Raven's Feather*, his katana with a storm of attacks and in a blink of an eye his Efretti's kusarigama appeared in it's other hand, the blade bit into him and the chain wrapped around him, but the mighty Vold shrugged it off easily.

On the other side of the darkness, the tentacles squeezed tighter on Ken ga ō sugiru, who was able to smash through the restraint this time. While the goblin attacked Taklak missing with it's scimitar.

Sufari fired her bow and missed again. She fired again and missed catastrophically, hitting Vold, who stopped laughing and glared out the window at his *friend*. And now it's a *Tavernlord brawl*!

Ere-Ooze lashed out it's psuedopod at Ken ga ō sugiru, splashing him with acid, searing into the creature. Grunddle drew *Ikite iru* the flaming sword that he took from Hi-no-shi-no-zugaikotsu in the battle earlier. The sword flew over and attacked Ken ga ō sugiru. The creature first stared at the weapon in amazement and shock and then anger when it realized that this could only mean that the previous owner was killed (again). 

Taklak and Stupid continued their offensive. Taklak cast [lightning lure](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-lure) and his blades cutting and biting, chasing the lighting as he smashed the goblin. Stupid chomped on to the last goblin, biting and scratching as Taklak slid in behind it and slashed into the last goblin.

Vold's morning star bit into Shadoukenku and drove him back again towards the dark area, this time the creature gaw'ked and stumbled back into the tentacles. 

Ere-Ooze attacked the Ken ga ō sugiru again, but it stepped out of the way, it's attention turned towards Grunddle. The creature let out a deep breath, spread out it's oversized chest and and lifted it's staff before it. Pausing in the beat of a second, it separated the weapon into two halves revealing two katana. And at the same time, two additional arms appeared beneath the creature's shoulders to draw two more katanas from his waist.

With an unbelievable speed the blades cut through the air, clipping off of his shimmering robes, with Grunddle dancing and dodging the lethal swords. The gnome planted both feet and grinned at the frustrated skeleton warrior.

Shadoukenku slipped free of the tentacles and flew out the window, looking to regain it's footing. Unfortunately, for the moment in it's haste to escape the tentacles, it forgot that Sufari had been positioned outside. The first shaft flew wide, but finally she struck the kenku down with her second attack.

Ere-Ooze attacked Ken ga ō sugiru, lunging through the monster. The acid completely engulfing the skeleton and then suddenly blowing it apart.

Grunddle turned his Illusory Blitz and struck down the last goblin.

The intruders vanquished, the Tavernlords began to lick their wounds and continue to recon the building. Erethil and Grunndle went back upstairs. 

When they got there they found Bear dead in the hallway, where he had leaned only moments before. The gnome, Rockhound, was unconscious and barely alive. And as they suspected, Grace Stamph was also dead.

As Erethil cast [cure wounds](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cure%20Wounds#content) on Rockhound to revive him, they began to hear a commotion downstairs.

## The Sword of Leilon
Suddenly without warning, eight then ten warriors in heavy platemail, armor gleaming reflecting the various light sources. Two warriors with the largest shields any of the Tavernlords had ever seen positioned themselves and their captain Dunchell marched into the room and announced the presence of the *Third Batalion of the Sword of Leilon*. He demanded that everyone surrender.

Ten became twelve. Then fifteen. Vold could see archers behind more of those tall shields posted outside the windows, where Sufari had been. Sufari noticed that the warriors had flanked them, but not all of them. She realized that Erethil and Grunndle were still upstairs.

They had brought a prisoner in with the last group of warriors. ***AJ Frost*** was brought in, with his hands bound in front of him. 

Dunchell continued to question Vold and Sufari. Vold explained that they had been cleared out one of Fat Cobra's outposts and followed the bandits here, where they found these raiders, who seemed to be from the same company.

>Vold: Fat Cobra, you're trying to catch him, right? You've heard of him?
>
>Dunchell: Of course, everyone knows about that brigand.

Mostly, but seemingly unconvinced, Dunchell *suggested* that they all surrender and either give up their weapons or fashion them so that they cannot be drawn and accompany to their next stop: West Harbor. *Or they would be taken*.

Grunddle came down with his hands up, special gloves with some of his spell components woven into them, secreted over his palms. Barely able to stand, out of grief as much as pain, Rockhound limped behind him. Vold looked around the room again and at the well covered archers, and surrendered, retracting his armband and removing it, putting into his bag. He made sure his *shield*, which earlier eaten a goblin, was securely fastened to his back. The rest of the Tavernlords and by default Taklak and Stupid followed... well, Vold.

The Sword surrounded them and drew their wagon and *warhorse*... Vold didn't remember having a warhorse. That's when he noticed the small, almost unnoticeable gleam shining from it's ear, it's slightly pointy ear. *Bastard, sneaky bastard...* Vold thought and grinned.

**What awaits in West Harbor?**
*Rumor has it that the place has fallen on **dark** times, if you recall*

**What about the Sword of Leilon?**
