## Escape
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fc-prison-escape-mid.JPG?raw=true)

The story opened with Vold and Grunddle having just escaped Vold's cell. Sufari and their new friend, ***[Tal](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/non-player-characters/tal-intro.md#tal)*** still trapped in their cells. Tal had summoned her double-bladed scimitar. Grunddle had his mage robes. Vold had his belt, but currently no other weapons. Sufari was unarmed and unarmored.

> Tal [Gnomish: translation] <*whispering*> **Friend gnome ... if you can free me, I can assist you!**
<*whispering*>
[understood by: Tal, Grunddle]
Vold Orcsbane [Dwarvish: translation] **Oh yeah?**
[understood by: Tal, Vold Orcsbane]
Grunddle [Gnomish: translation] **For my next trick, we free both of the elf ladies.**
[understood by: Tal, Grunddle]
Tal [Gnomish: translation] **Huzzah!**
[understood by: Tal, Grunddle]

Unequipped or not, Sufari was far from helpless, she grabbed the bedding off the floor and wrapped it around two bars, twisting it, turning it - trying to move the bars. Meanwhile, Vold stepped over Grunddle and out into the corridor, where he lined up three of the guards and let loose his fiery breath weapon. One of the half-orc guards spun deftly out of the way, while the remaining goblin and other half-orc guard were caught up in the fire.

One of the half-orc bosses starting barking orders to his men in orcish and advanced. He waved his battle axe over his head menacingly, trying to rally his troops. The half-orc guard shook off the fire and attacked Vold with his short sword, but missed, still riled by being on fire. The second half-orc boss began advancing on the melee, but was still too far from the combat to engage. 

Grunddle re-summoned his [familiar](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Find%20Familiar#content) "Bandit", the flying monkey, right on top of the half-orc guard who had the large stone key on a chain around his neck. The monkey grabbed and spun away from the guard, flying over to Sufari's cell, holding the key out in front of her! The goblin that Bandit flew over to get to Sufari, swung it's scimitar, slicing in to the flying monkey. 

>Grunddle [Gnomish: translation] **I only freed Sufari first because I know her. You're next - promise!**
[understood by: Tal, Grunddle]
Tal [Gnomish: translation] **Thank you friend gnome! I understand the bonds of loyalty!**
[understood by: Tal, Grunddle]

Sufari took the key from the monkey, moved it behind her and opened the cell. 

The other half-orc guard lashed out at Vold, missing again. Vold grinned at the flailing guard and continued to pummel the smuldering half-orc. Unfortunately for the half-orc, being on fire made it much more difficult to avoid being smashed in the face by the angry dragon born. His face collapsed with a sickening crunch as Vold put his fist through it.

Grunddle moved quickly over to Tal's cell. Theatrically, he put a finger in the locking mechanism and motioned for her to step back with his other hand. The lock began to glow white hot, melting! The cell door swung open, freeing Tal. Grunddle, in his element, embraced the moment smirking and flirting a little, before moving on to part 7b of his *elaborate and complicated escape plan!*

Tal patted the gnome on the back and moved quickly past him. True to her word, she *could handle herself*, swinging her double-bladed scimitar up through the half-orc boss, slicing clean through it from crotch to sternum. Standing proudly over it, like Grunddle, taking a moment to admire her handiwork, as it fell over nearly in two pieces.

The goblin swung it's scimitar at Sufari, but the weaopn slipped from it's hands. It couldn't believe it's eyes as Sufari caught it, with a sparkle of magic imbued from the flying monkey. She winked at the goblin and in one lithe move, she eviserated the goblin from belly to chin.

Vold continued his attack, tearing into the advancing boss, putting all of his strength into it, he smashed the creature and knocked it back down the corridor. The half-orc wailed in anger and charged back to Vold, slashing him with his great axe. 

Seeing the two elfin women slaughter two of his guards, the last boss, pulled out a ball of yarn from his belt. It laughed at them and mockingly tossed the yarn between them. A burst of dust exploded from the ball of yarn... a sleep spell. Immune... Tal just laughed. Sufari just shook it off, dropped the scimitar, reached down picked up the poor excuse for a short bow that the goblin had carried and grabbed what passed for an arrow out of it's quiver. She somersaulted into the middle of the hallway and fired a fatal shot through the half-orc's forehead and into the wall, way behind him.

Vold taunted the last half-orc, he took a moment to open his arms wide, expanding his chest, baring his teeth, "Look around!" and then with lightning speed, shoved his fingers through the guard's eyes, killing him instantly.

In their cells for less than ten minutes, the Tavernlords found themselves, already freed.

## No way out
Sufari went up the stairs to the *ceiling trap door*. She tried the over-sized stone key in the lock and turned it. They could all hear the locking mechanism work, but she couldn't budge the door. Vold went to the top of the stairs and issued forth his mightiness, but the two of them couldn't budge the slab. Grunddle offered to enlarge Vold... but they decided that the logistics of the spiral staircase was not in their favor for that manuever. Vold continued to push on the ceiling as the others began to look around the room for other options.

They considered waiting for the changing of the guard, but Tal informed them that she judged that it was days between shift changes. They looked around and found bags of what they assumed was *food* for the creatures and multiple receptacles for their excrement.

Unbeknownst to the Tavernlords and Tal, the locking mechanism also opened a concealed portal. Tal was checking the southern wall and was shocked when her hand went right through, what was apparently, an illusion of the wall. She cautiously stepped forward and found herself in another hallway. The others quickly, but carefully followed her.

They found this part of the *prison* much better kept than the other side. Where the stones had been old, dirty and disgusting, littered with the refuge of the guards, this area was clean, even the stone walls were cleaner.

When they came to a crossroads, Vold slid to the left while Tal and the others went to the right. Vold had just discovered another spiral staircase, when he heard shouting from the other passage. He rushed over to see that they had found another prisoner, beaten and bruised, there was a drow behind a set of bars.

Inspecting the cell, the Tavernlords noticed that the cell was different than the ones that they had just escaped. The bars seemed newer and maybe better made.

The prisoner, who called himself *Soluun*, begged for them to free him and warned that *the creatures* would be coming back any time now. He begged and begged, telling them that he was a member of the Bregan D’arerthe in Waterdeep and if they freed him, he promised a reward. Desperate, he even offered 1,000 gold pieces each! Dejected, he told them that he had been here for months! Using [insight](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Insight_Skill), they were convinced of his sincerity on all points.

Of course they had all heard of the Bregan D’arerthe, the legendary drow mercenary guild that operated from Lantan all the way down the Sword Coast to Waterdeep. 

Vold was unconvinced, he did not trust or like the drow, wary of their nefarious ways. A discussion was had. Tal was the most sympathetic. Grunddle saw the value of setting him free. Vold was adamant, *nothing good could come from freeing him*. In the end, it was decided, that they would set the prisoner free.

After determining that the cell itself wasn't magic, they began the actual task of freeing Soluun. Grunddle tried his magic finger-in the-lock trick, but this time he was only successful at fusing the lock's mechanism together. The mighty Vold tried to pull the cell open, but could barely budge it. But budge it he did, and he thought he felt the mechanism holding the door closed shift. He tried again and again to no avail. At one point he even thought that he might have re-caught whatever he had pulled free. Tal, confident in her own strength tried. Again, it shifted, but remained fastened. Vold let out a low growl, grabbed the bars and finally pulled the gate open.

Freed! Soluun, moved past Vold patting him on the back. Vold spun and pushed his hands away, while only slightly larger, Vold seemed to tower over the battered drow. "Don't... ever... touch me."

Soluun put up his hands in surrender, "Never again, thank you dragon... your strength is legendary." He said as he turned and winked at Tal.

It was also agreed that Soluun would be Tal's responsibility. That if he stepped out of line, she would have to take care of him, or Vold would take care of both of them. *For her part, Tal wasn't sure that would go the way Vold thought, but she was agreeable to the bargain.*

Vold told the rest about the stairs that he had found. Solunn emplored the team to go down the other way, insisting that the *wolfthings*, which he described as 10 feet tall and *sharp at every end* went that way and that they should go the other way. Reminding them that the *wolfthings* would be back soon.

The team decided to go down the closer hall, the were able to force open the barred gate much easier than the cell. They found that the hallway led to what appeared to be troop quarters. They surmised that the four rooms held no less than twenty creatures. Maybe even more. And still, this side of the prison was much cleaner, more well kept than the other side. Even the creature's barracks were a mess, obviously not the home of *civilized* creatures, but still, not entirely untidy.

They moved down past the barracks and continued down the hall. Tal stopped, noticing another gate, appearing to lead down another long hallway, as the others continued on. Vold ducked into one of the doorways and was astonished by what he found.

## Crystalline Mysteries

Like the prison, there was no light in this part of the *facility*. As Vold moved carefully into the large room, he immediately saw the large, seven foot tall, four feet wide and at least three feet deep, crystal structure along the back wall. The structure was barely translucent, almost opaque. There was a an odd protrusion, a cylinder that looked like it was built into the front of the crystal. While the rest of the crystal appeared to be colorless - or rather seemed to refract all sorts of colors, almost like a kaleidoscope - the cylinder was made of a different kind of crystal, more translucent and green. 

Vold knocked on face of the large crystal, it felt and sounded solid. He could make something out inside, but he wasn't quite sure what it was. He pressed his face to it to try to get a better look and wasn't astonished, but a little surprised to see what looked like an elf inside! A naked, male elf, suspended in the crystal.

The others soon joined him and continued to examine the strange structure. Grunddle couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he thought that there was something wrong with the elf, something just not quite right.

Solunn was unimpressed, and reminded them that the giant wolf-creature would be back soon. After a brief discussion, the Tavernlords (and Tal) decided that they had time to look in a couple other rooms. 

The room directly across from the elf was empty. The room next to that one had a crystalline chamber that was identical, but inside the *thing* was less of a body and more like an abomination... like the bones of the creature had been broken and shoved into a skin-bag... there may have been arms or legs... and a head-bulb. Vold thought it reminded him of something that he'd killed, skinned and was preparing to eat. His stomach turned. There was some discussion of whether the thing was forming or unforming, being *unmade*... it was impossible to tell.

In the room across the hall, next to the first room with the *elf*, they found another crystalline chamber. Inside this one was a black dragonborn! Again, Grunddle thought that there was something *just not quite right*, like maybe seeing a clown performer who had forgotten to put make up on a part of his face, something was just off, *uneven*. And he tried to think *being made or unmade*... but was still unsure.

The team moved on to the room next to the dragonborn, where they found another structure. Inside this structure they were dumbfounded to find AJ Frost, naked as the day he was born. And *maybe a little younger*?

They didn't know whether these were being grown to replace the originals or if they were the originals. They didn't know if these were even being grown or being *unmade*, but Vold knew one thing, he was going to smash that this one into little bits.

Before anyone could caution him or try to dissuade him, he slammed his new (really crappy) battleaxe into the crystal. The held firm, but he could see that he made a scratch - he at least hurt it.

Grunddle, seeing the damage, cast a fire bolt at the crystalline chamber. A few inches from face of the structure, his fire seemed to be colorful flakes and dissipate before it reached it's target.

Tal, whipped her double-bladed scimitar around, with speed and grace and slammed the weapon into the crystal. A stronger weapon, in very competent hands, the face of the structures splintered. Vold smashed his battle axe into the crack again and again. Tal helped, Sufari kept an eye on the drow.

After a few minutes of smashing, they finally breached the chamber. A horrible hiss spewed out, with a terrible stench of iron and... sulfur. They watched in horror as *Frost's* body went from a relaxed slump to an erect posture, all of it's limbs straight down. Suddenly, as the air hit the body it suddenly appeared as if someone were tightening it's skin! Drawing it in, it's features sucking inwards. The limbs contracted and they could hear bones cracking. It made a ghastly exhale as whatever air was inside of it's body was pushed through it's mouth as it's skull collapsed inwards. In seconds, it was gone, smashed into a... paste? clay? Muck? *This is still the mere...*... and then it turned to dust, falling into the blood-like ochre that it had been floating in inside the chamber.

They stood there confused, nowhere closer to knowing whether these were creations or prisoners.

Vold decided, either way, he needed to free the other dragonborn. He went and began smashing the crystal in the next room. Tal went to help him.

When he was finished, Soluun leaned into the room, "Okay, that was great, can we go now?" 

They deduced that these were likely clones of some kind, that were either being used or going to be used to replace the originals. They all stared at Soluun. "You say you've been here months? There's probably one of these that looks like you roaming around out there," Vold nodded towards the ceiling.

Soluun gufawed, "All the more reason to get out of here, so I can take care of it then, eh?"

"We should check out the other hallway." Tal said, remembering the passage that they had passed between these rooms and the wolfkin quarters. They all agreed.

They were astonished. There four rows of rooms all of them, but four had chambers. Most of them were identifiable as *something*... some were even identifiable as ***someone***... remarkably, terrifyingly, they were people whom they had either heard of, seen drawings or paintings or had indeed met!

They even found one that was certainly Soluun! He was clearly disturbed. He obviously hadn't really taken them seriously when Vold suggested that there might be a doppelganger of him. But seeing it, hearing it and seeing the others was one thing. being face-to-face with this *thing* was a whole other story altogether.

It was decided that they would smash this one too. They watched Soluun carefully as the body inside the crystal disintegrated. As it crumbled, he looked he someone had punched him in the stomach, but he was really no worse for wear. "Okay,... can we go. Now. Please." He said through grit teeth.

The list of the ones that they recognized:
>**Overlord Gareth Oakboar** - the ruler of Leilon.
>
>Waterdeep's ruler, **Openlord Laeral Silverhand**.
>
>**Magister Kylynne Silmerhelve** - the chief adjudicator for Openlord Laeral Silverhand, the woman who had authenticated their deed to Trollskull manor!
>
>**Captain Guryon**, the tabaxi Watch captain who befriended the Tavernlords.
>
>Tal found her friend and mentor, **Einrich**. She and Vold smashed that one open too.
>
>There was even a strangely shaped crystalline chamber that housed a beholder, no doubt the >**Xanathar**!
>
>**Reneer Neverember**, the man they rescued and their sometimes benefactor.
>
>a captain of Waterdeep's Guard **Aumarr Shain Ravenhook**.
>
>***Cricket***, Thaggus the Harbor Master's trusted *accountant*, who would occasionally visit the tavern wit his mates.
>
>There was even one that looked like **Fat Cobra!** unmistakeable even without his tattoos.
>
>The *second-most* disturbing find was four rooms, with one chamber in each, in each of them was the same man, in various stages from late middle-age to what appeared to old age. Tal thought it looked like the long-thought dead wizard **Manshoon**. Manshoon, who had been a founder of the Zhentarim and was known to have extended his own twisted life at least three times using **clones**.
>
>And finally, the most off-putting crystalline chamber held the body of their friend... **Barakka**!

There were also five humans, one halfling, two elves, a dwarf and a gnome that none of them knew how to identify.

## Escape, finally!
It had been over an hour since they busted open the first of the four chambers that they shattered. A confusing, frustrating and terrifying hour. Soluun was absolutely beside himself, certain that these wolf-things, which had all-but become an afterthought to the others. Finally they decided that it was time to leave. 

In the hallway, on the other side of the wolfkin quarters, they found another room with a spiral staircase leading to the ceiling. Sufari went up to the top to try the key. Again, they heard some kind of mechanism, but a different sound. The door in the prison sounded like large metal mechanisms moving, under the command of the small stone key. This time, it sounded like air being let out of a bladder. Sufari was sure it would be too heavy for her to move, but she tried and to her surprise, it lifted slightly. Vold and Tal moved up and pushed the platform open and they left the dark, dank stairway into the humid, muck of the Mere of Deadmen.

They looked around and saw that they were just on the outside of Fat Cobra's compound.

Solunn was ready to head back to Waterdeep. The Tavernlords still felt like they had unfinished business here. There was the matter of Erethil and Taklak. And their gear. And of course, *what the heck was going on down there?*

The drow insisted that he be allowed to head back to Waterdeep. He even offered help from the Bregan D’arerthe. He told them that he could even gain the favor of Jarlaxe Baenre, the legendary/notorious leader of the Bregan D'arethe and could bring a force down on this place so hard that the mere would swallow it up.

Vold was not inclined to just *let him go*. He was a drow after all and had clear connections to even more, naughtier drow. They calculated the route to return to Waterdeep and get back and figured it about about two weeks. Definitely unacceptable.

Tal suggested that she could take him back. The Tavernlords seemed okay with that. Sufari suggested that whether they let him go or took him back it didn't really make any difference. He was either going to get killed by something on the way or get back to his friends and do whatever they were going to do. Sufari said that Tal could do what she wanted, but she was welcome to stay with them. *Figuring they were going to need any (non-drow) help that they could get*. 

Tal thought it out. It would be a trying journey back to Waterdeep, where neither would be able to trust the other. Least of all, her trusting him. And when/if she got him there, there was no guarantee that the Bregan D'aerthe wouldn't just take her prisoner or worse. Besides, she kind of liked these guys and if Einrich was out there, she had to try to find him.

Meanwhile, Sufari (the ranger) had been making a mental map of the facility. She started to wonder, **Did the location of the bodies have any relevance?***

**I, for one, can't wait to hear the plan for what comes next...**

*Rescue* Erethil & Taklak?
...say, where are Erethil & Taklak?

What are those things in the crystal structures?
Do they need stopping/destroying...?
...or rescuing?!?

And just *who can you trust*...

Certainly not:
