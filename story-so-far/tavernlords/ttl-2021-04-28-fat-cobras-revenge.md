## Aftermath continued

The outpost was cleared. The Tavernlords had two prisoners and had looted the villain's treasure. It was clear, from the looks of the lair that it was a permanent base of some kind, but also that it was more like temporary lodging, a base to set-up, to stage attacks and what not. The snarky goblin prisoner confirmed as much between his whining, begging for mercy and taunting. *Gobs, right?*

After much discussion, it was decided that they couldn't just kill the prisoners, who had after all, surrendered. They also couldn't just be left free, to their own devices. Finally, they were left seated at the bottom of the pit, wrapped tightly by Erethil's *Spider-elf*'s webbing to each other, the floor and the walls. With a thick layer of webbing over them for good measure.

Also it was decided that they didn't really want to take the chance that the goblin was telling the truth and that the next band of brigands was due back at any time. Vold and Sufari drank two of the potions of healing and the team got ready to set off. 

As usual, because it has worked out so well so far, Sufari took the lead. She climbed the stairs, opened the hatch and pushed out into the late afternoon air. She managed to get into the field, when she was hit by a barrage of arrows.

## Surrounded!
Just like that the serenity of the afternoon was broken by a hail of violence. Sufari stumbled back, even as Vold moved on to the battlefield. The arrows in the elf were as plain as day, but where had they come from? 

The glade fell eerily silent and still as the mighty dragonborn strode into the battlefield. Then suddenly another volly of projectiles filled the air. Sufari and Vold both took hits. As Vold grew angrier, Sufari was once again beginning to re-think this whole *going first* thing, or maybe she wasn't.

Meanwhile, below on the stairs, Grunddle cast a [sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sanctuary) spell on Erethil, giving the ever-dangerous shapeshifter that much more protection befor he slid out, in giant spider form onto the field.

Erethil wasted no time, shifting quickly into panther form and leaping into the tree line, the bolting up into the canopy of low branches. From his new vanatage point he could see two goblin archers taking aim and firing at his friends.

Sufari, having regained her footing, arrow shafts sticking out of her, cast [fog cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fog-cloud), concealing the Tavernlords and the hatch to the outpost from the would-be assassins. 

Not the sharpest tools in the shed, arrows continued to fly through the fog. Some gobs shooting where they had last trained their deadly attacks, other just shooting in that general area. While the fog gave them some cover, they still found themselves ample targets and arrows flew all around them.

Clearly outnumbered, that's when Erethil the panther does some of his best work. He launched himself at the two closest goblins and struck!

From behind the fallen tree, an invisible figure, Gerrish, the captain of this particular goblin squad moved to the front of the log and pulled out one of his trademark weapons, a ball of yarn with a devistating [sleep](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sleep) spell cast upon it.

*Crap* Sufari thought as the *harmless looking* ball of yarn rolled up to her feet. Before she could react, before she could kick it away, the spell burst and she fell fast asleep. Vold, standing beside her raged and tore off towards the treeline where Erethil had gone. Where the last barrage of arrows had come from.

From the safety and security of the stairway below, Grunddle reacted quickly and pulled Sufari back down in to the outpost, as her fog cloud disspated with her consciousness. *Saving her, decisively **not** hiding from the obvious horde of goblins topside*.

## *Illusions!*
Vold and Erethil began to tear through the goblins closet to them, all the while being continually bombarded by arrows from the other side of the field. With the fog cleared, and the goblins advancing from their cover, they could see at least three more pairs surrounding them. 

Vold and the Trollskull mimic made a devistating pair, lashing out. It was Vold, with one of the massive swings of his battleaxe, enraged and unchecked, who discovered that they were not as outnumbered as it may have seemed. His mighty blow swung through the goblin, with an unsatifying ease, in fact there was nothing to connect with at all. It was all he could do to keep his balance as his axe swung around clean through one of the goblins. The vision wavered, *maybe grinned at him?*, and then vanished! *An illusion!*

So now they knew that not all of their foes were real, but which was real and which was the illusion. From a distance, it was too hard to tell. Vold and Erethil continued to move through the goblins, tearing into some, completely dispelling others with their deadly attacks.

Below, Grunddle and *Bandit* the flying monkey woke Sufari. Just in time to see the hatch open and the captain, Gerrish peer down at them and toss in another ball of yarn!

One of the goblins got off a clean blow with his scimitar and knocked the Trollskull mimic out cold. Even more enraged Vold tore straight through the Gob.

Sufari managed to avoid being put to sleep by Gerrish for a third time. Grunddle was not so lucky. The goblin captain advanced on them with his gleaming handaxe. Sufari stepped back and fired her bow, after helping Grunddle come back around.

Gerrish's Axe of Storms was no match for Sufari's deadly aim and Grunddle's merciless illusions. Despite dealing a few serious blows to Sufari, including unleashing a blitz of lightning on her, Gerrish withstood a volley of Grunddle's *illusory arrows* and the battle continued. Grunddle gave Sufari the *Luzieros signal* and she carefully rolled out of the way. With a wicked grin, the gnome unleashed a [thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave), centered on the goblin, in the small hallway. It wouldn't be a Tavernlord adventure if the thunderwave didn't deal some friendly fire, *Bandit* was blasted to his next life, even as the devastating spell also dropped Gerrish.

And just like that, the Tavernlords were victorious. Again, with Sufari and Vold taking the brunt of the damage. *Funny how that keeps happening*. To be fair, Grunddle's *sanctuary* spell saved Erethil from a great deal of damage, while if it weren't for Grunddle's quick thinking and dragging Sufari below, Gerrish woudl have surely had a much easier target for his cleaver up above.

## *What Comes Next?*
So it turned out that the goblin prisoner was telling the truth and there was another party due. Who knew when the next one would come. They still wanted to go back to the Weeping Willow Inn to drop off the mysterious tome. But they were a little beaten and worn.

Worst still, the directional sigils that AJ Frost had shown them were gone. There wasn't a hide nor hair of them to be found on any tree. They could go a little ways back the way the came, but then it all kind of just looked like marsh.

Betrayed! Vold was convinced that Frost had set them up, at least had left them stranded on the mere. With all the illusions that they had seen today, it was a short leap to the idea that *AJ Frost, the debonair scoundrel, was actually Fat Cobra!* Well, even if he was just a scoundrel, Vold was not having it and there was a battle axing in someone's future.

Sufari, a forest elf was definitely out of her element. Erethil went through a variety of shapes trying to see if he could ear or smell any trace of their way back. To no avail.

It was decided that they would move on down the road, just about 30 yards, to get clear of the field, and set up an encampment where they could rest and recover. Grunddle took the opportunity to create a new *Bandit*, another flying monkey to fly ahead and scout out directions to the Inn.

Meanwhile, they took stock of the new lot equipment and *treasure* that they recovered. For the most part that *treasure* amounted to Gerrish's handaxe and what appeared to be a few ordinary rocks that he had in his pocket.

After their rest, Grunddle cast a ritual [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell on the rocks. One of the otherwise ordinary looking rocks was indeed some kind of divination magic. Grunddle waved it around, holding it up, looking at it as closely as possible, in the light. As he moved it around, a sigil appeared on a tree nearby.

The flying monkey dispatched, they needed only wait for his return. In fact, with the sigils, they decided that they could even start down the road and catch it on it's way back. A palpable feeling of relief was starting to come over them, something was *finally breaking their way*.

That's when they saw the shimmering lights in the marsh ahead of them. The grinding metal symphony, crashing through the mere heralded the arrival of the strange elemental, of the kind that they had seen before.

Emerging from the elemental, directly in front of them were three bullywugs, a clawfoot raptor and *this guy*...
