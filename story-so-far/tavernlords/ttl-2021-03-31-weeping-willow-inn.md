# The Mystery of the Mere of Dead Men (part three)
## Home away from home (March 31, 2021)

In the morning, Kehrle and Laura set out to lead the Tavernlords from the High Road to the Weeping Willow Inn, where Waterdeep had secured lodging for the team for as long as they needed for their investigation.

Travel in the mere was restricted to foot as the terrain could be dangerously unpredictable because of the sludge and the muck. As promised, there were few points of interest between the two landmarks and because of the terrain there was also no clearly identifiable road.

Travel to the Inn took about half the day and the Tavernlords arrived just in time for lunch. As the party approached the inn **Chick**, from Willow's the legendary *Three Orcs* was standing guard outside. Like Bog Luck before him, upon seeing them heading toward the Inn, he waved an enthusiastic greeting, with his axe in the air above his head.

Brief introductions were made and to their surprise apparently the entire inn was a buzz, anticipating the Tavernlord's arrival. Chick led party inside, pretending not to *size-up* Vold as Vold pretended not to *measure the orc for a proper beat down*, where the owner and operator of the Inn was waiting for them.

**Lady Grace Stamph**, a stately half-elf, inherited the inn from her husband, when he was murdered over a decade ago. Her and her adult son, "Harry" (*Harroh*) have been keeping the Inn a relatively safe harbor for travelers, mostly free from whatever hullabaloo was rising in the marsh. *And there is always something cooking in the mere*.

Even though she was a modest spell-caster and savvy entrepreneur, the mere is a tough and dangerous swamp. The unsavory elements of the mere quickly tried to move in on the one notable stand-alone (not in a village or a town) inn in the entire mere. Things were starting to look bleak until she and her loyal *groundsman*, **Rockhound** came up with the idea to hire some muscle. Rockhound knew just the muscle to call: a trio of orcs, some old friends from his *roughneck* days. And just like that, their fortunes were changed.

Since then, the Inn has thrived. A neutral site, friends to both West Harbor, Leilon, Waterdeep and travelers through region.

**Rockhound** (*the Rockhound*) first met *Dyrek Stamph* when they were running *jobs* and adventuring out of Leilon. They became fast and life-long friends. When Stamph retired to near-anonymity and bought an inn in the middle of the Mere of Deadmen, the notorious *five-fingerman* Rockhound retired with him. Pretty much good at everything he does, Rockhound helps maintain the Inn and handles any other undercommon-related business that might come through the Weeping Willow.

A lifetime of experience working with both sides of the law have made him a great judge of character. And has made him very good at keep track of who is up to what around the mere. Even though he is *out of the life*, the Rockhound keeps his ear to the ground and every once in a while, his fingers in a little business.

As fiercely loyal as Rockhound is to Lady Grace and Harry, the orc, Bear, and his *brothers*  share the same fealty with the gnome. A fact none of them ever speak of.

Lady Grace greeted the Tavernlords and delivered them to Rockhound in the bar. He helped them find a table and took their orders. Already well acquainted with Kehrle and Laura, the Rockhound made easy conversation with the  new arrivals.

It didn't take long, which was good, because time was a factor. A quick signal from Rockhound and Lady Grace came over to the table. After asking and finding out that the Tavernlords were bereft of any real leads, she asked them if they would consider following up on another crime, that would if nothing else, help turn over a few more stones. They agreed to hear her out and she brought **Eklas Kisri** (*Ellie*), an female halfling, starting to tend towards the older side, over to the table.

Ellie moved slowly and tenderly, it was easy to see from her appearance that she had taken quite a beating very recently. She explained that she and her traveling companions were attacked yesterday morning. One of them was nearly-mortally wounded and the other was killed outright. As devastated as she was by the fates of her comrades, she was obviously even more desperate to recover what was taken from her. She explained that they took a satchel that contained a pendant with a large ruby surrounded by diamonds and opals and three very, important unique tomes.

As it turned out, a *swarm of goblins* and two ogres attacked them about two miles from the Inn. It's the Tavernlords, so they were probably in from the word go, but *goblins*! Sufari knew it had to be Fat Cobra. And that was an open score that needed settling. Of course they agreed to do it.

A quick conversation around the bar about how to draw out these goblins, and the concern that might take too long, sparked the one other patron in the bar to speak up.

**AJ Frost**
A handsome man, dressed in a fancy, form-fitting custom suit of black leather armor, who had been sitting quietly in the back of the bar offered to lead the Tavernlords to a nearby goblin lair. 

*AJ Frost*, a familiar face at the Weeping Willow Inn and around the Mere. A high-priced *sell-sword* and a *operator* along the Sword Coast, Frost had a reputation for always being in the middle of the firestorm, and always coming out smelling like a rose, even if his *enterprise* went belly-up.

Frost and the Rockhound have a mutual *love-hate* relationship. Neither has much use for one another, but they trade partial secrets and small favors. This relationship finds Frost at the Inn on a semi-regular basis, whether Rock or Grace particularly like it or not.

Frost offered to lead them to the hideout for 10% of their fee. He also insisted that he wouldn't fight and wouldn't stick around. They Tavernlords agreed.

There was still the matter of Ellie's near-dead *friend*, Riziasi. It turns out that the diminutive, skinny halfling woman, who had been severely beaten herself, carried he huge tabaxi friend, who was nearly twice her size, almost half a mile before Chick, the orc, found them.

Alas, when Chick brought them back to the Inn, Rockhound pronounced Riziasi *very nearly, almost dead*. It was all that he could do with his meager medicine skills to keep the tabaxi at death's door. And that's where Erethil came in and magicked him back to health. Exhausted, still recovering from the shock of being *very nearly, almost dead*, he was still anxious get back out into the mere to chase down the missing property.

That was when Ellie told him about their other companion, and the mighty tabaxi suddenly deflated. He still wanted to go, but she persuaded him to let the Tavernlords go first. And that they would follow after the two of them had a chance to get their footing. It wasn't perfect, she didn't like it either, but the two of them were physically recovering and more importantly, at the moment they were unarmed and barely equipped. And no one at the Inn seemed ready to let them rush headlong into danger.

Most of the Tavernlords were settled into their staterooms on the second floor. While Grunddle, Laura, Kerhle, Rockhound, Frost and an occasional orc played *Bog's Luck* into the wee hours of the morning.

Grunddle learned a lot playing dice with the locals. It's one of the reasons he likes playing, that and he usually wins. He already knew that he liked Laura and Kerhle. Rockhound was definitely his kind of guy and he could see why the orcs were Rock's choice of muscle for the Inn and believed that they actually were as invested in the prosperity of the joint as the gnome and Lady Grace. Clearly whatever Rockhound, the orcs and the fine Lady's husband had been up to in their storied past, they were fiercely bonded by it. And Grunddle liked that a lot. Much like the tavern, between the Roadhouse and Inn he was starting to think the Mere of Deadmen had some promising prospects for the future. And he liked to always keep his options open and having friends in every port.

After AJ retired for the night, a big morning of marsh-guiding ahead of him, Grunddle dug for more info on their guide. Rockhound told him that he was, like many of the *unsavories* in the swamp, not to be trusted. He made a point not to distance himself and his comrades too far from that statement, as clearly this was once his preferred territory as well. Even if his *pirate* or whatever days were behind him. He described AJ as *shiftless*, but more deadly than he would let on. AJ often did business out of the Weeping Willow, perhaps using the muscle of inn to keep the peace for him and using the mere for better cover than operating on the High Road (Carnath). He frequently dealt with *people folk* and was unlikely to be working with the gobs or Fat Cobra, who most people in the area held in some form of contempt or another. Still, the Rockhound described Frost as a scoundrel and someone not to be trusted, but finished his commentary by comparing Frost to *ol Dyrek* a little wistfully and with a little disdain.

### Ambushing the ambush

The next morning, AJ Frost met the Tavernlords in front of the inn, ready to go. 

The journey through the marsh was as silent as it was uneventful. It was easy to see why they needed a guide, there was scant few landmarks and Frost made no effort to explain why he went one way or the other,through the road-less swamp.

Finally AJ stopped and announced that they were *here*. He gestured off in the distance, towards a slightly drier part of the marsh. Still mucky, there was a small *pasture* area with a large fallen tree in the middle. The Tavernlords looked at him dismayed. Vold, sick of the swamp, considered introducing Frost to the working end of his morningstar armblade. Finally Frost relented and pointed towards the tree. Under the tree is the entrance he told them. And then announced that he was done and would meet them back at the Inn to collect his share of their fee, or they could leave it with Rockhound if he wasn't there.

Erethil and Vold stopped him immediately, demanding that he wait for them. How else would they get back? Frost sighed and reminded them that he had only agreed to get them here. Still he said that he understood their predicament. 

Reluctantly he waved more than pointed his hand towards a near by tree and gestured at a strange mark. He told them that this was the mark for *West Harbor*. He made another gesture towards another tree and on the south-facing side of it, another sigil seemed to appear, *Leilon*. Not really *appear* so much as become more obvious. It was as if these carvings were always there, but somehow fell just beneath their notice. He pointed at a large boulder, the size of a troll, sticking out of the mere, on it were three other sigils: *Waterdeep*, *Carnath* and one that he didn't identify (*Castle Naertyar*), with arrows carved beneath them. He told them that these markers were around and that seasoned travelers knew how to look for them and once found, they could always be seen. Like an obvious secret, in plain sight. He shook his head, and he told them now that they knew, *they knew* and should be able to find their way back to the Inn.

They looked around and indeed, there were even other marks that he hadn't pointed out on some of the landscape. It was a shock, almost, that they hadn't noticed them before. He told them, not to be surprised and that usually they are more subtle, but *surely Fat Cobra and his gobs picked this spot because it had so many markers* and he pointed back to the fallen log and started back towards the Inn.

*Surely*...

In truth, most folk familiar with the mere did use the same landmarks, but not all of them knew of the runes. Some had maps, some just knew those landmarks well enough to find them. The *Rune Road* was an ancient legacy of the swamp, so mysterious in origin that most believed it to be more myth than fact.

What he didn't tell the Tavernlords was that while the markers were real, *well most of them*, they weren't plainly visible. They required a special, usually magical, means to identify him. Frost, for example, carried a small stone secreted away in a hidden belt pouch that allowed him to see them. And a cantrip here or there allowed the Tavernlords to see them as well. *Or see what appeared to be runes*... But that's a story for another day.

Cautious, as they always are, the Tavernlords decided to stake out the glade. They waited and waited but no returned, nor emerged from the tree trunk. Finally they decided to approach the lair. Erethil and Sufari struck out along the trees on either side of the pasture, deftly sneaking through the foliage, while Vold, Grunddle and *Bandit*, the flying monkey waited *patiently*.

Finally Erethil, now in panther-form, found one of the goblin sentries and the battle was joined. In his panther-form, Erethil made quick work of the foul creatures, rending them with mighty claws and strong, sharp jaws. Pouncing mercilessly on the unsuspecting and hapless goblins. Sufari blasted one with her arrows as well, but Erethil carved through them like they were little more than leaves in the wind.

With the area clear and the danger more strewn about than subdued, the Tavernlords finally made their way to the fallen tree. There Erethil's panther-form sniffed out that ogres had indeed gone this way. While Sufari, maybe a little focused for her own good, found the track of goblins, which also led beneath the tree.

The team inspected the marsh carefully and were able to identify the outline of a large, *10x10ish* door, that lay beneath the fallen tree. They found the hinges, and saw that it was clearly designed to fall into some kind of passage that the creatures could escape down into.

Opening the door, with the extreme caution that they always exhibit, they unearthed a staircase that lead into a subterranean lair. The stairs were carved into the ground and reinforced with wooden steps. The walls around the tunnel were also reinforced by wooden planks down the hall, leading to a pair of wooden doors.

After inspecting the doors, the mighty Vold kicked through the doors and entered the room. It was a rather large room, with some wooden floorboards, except where the floorboards had been cracked and the dirt below was revealed, *or so it seemed*.

Seeing the room *clear of danger*, except for the chest in the corner, Vold had his *mimic friend* check to see if the chest were also a mimic, *surprisingly, it was not*. Vold asked the mimic to take the form of a key to try to open the chest, and while the mimic could enter the lock, it couldn't operate the locking mechanism. With Sufari closer to other door and Erethil near her, Vold used the mimic to transform into a crowbar and pried the chest open. 

Suddenly there was a blaring sound, an alarm that sounded like a cross between a drum and an animal's howl that rang forth from the corner. Before anyone realized what was happening, the floor, about twenty feet from the corner of the room, fell away into tiles. Vold and Grunddle tumbled into a pit, crashing on the floor some twenty feet below.

Meanwhile the sound of the alarm alerted whoever was on the other side of that door opposite of the chest. Even without trying, or maybe it was his imagination, but Erethil was sure that he could hear *something, maybe a lot of somethings,* coming towards them on the other side of that door.
