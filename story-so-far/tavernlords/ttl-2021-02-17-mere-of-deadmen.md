# Mystery of the Mere of Dead Men

## The death of Vold
### February 17, 2021

It began on the 17th of Nightal 1492, when the ***mysterious*** Jubelle Excelon paid a visit to Trollskull Manor. It was the morning after the tavern was firebombed and no one was at their best. Also, no one was quite ready for the news that Jubble brought with him. He had made an arrangement with the city officials of Waterdeep for Erethil, Sufari, Grunddle and Vold to take on a special assignment.The mission: investigate some missing cargo shipments between Waterdeep and Leilon over the past month.

Gunddle, for one, was disheartened by the news. He was really enjoying being a *Tavernlord* and especially enjoying playing to a full house every night. The tavern was like his second home, maybe even more like his first. Leaving was, disappointing. But he'd made a deal, they had an arrangement, he shook on it and took their strange black opal. *They*, just who were *they* and *Jubble Exelon* anyway? To top it off, *Bandit, the trash panda* had run off. Some days you can't buy winning dice. Shaking his head, agreeing to Jubble's mission, Grunddle reached into the pocket of his fancy new robe and grabbed his *special dice*. Unless of course, *you've fixed the game.*

The next morning the four *assigned* Tavernlords and, of course Jubble, reported to Waterdeep's Open Court, where they stood before **the magister [Kylynne Silmerhelve](http://oakthorne.net/wiki/index.php?title=House_Silmerhelve).** Silmerhelve, a tiefling lord, who oversees Force Grey and a good deal of the *unscrupulous* business that goes in and around Waterdeep. Respected and feared throughout Waterdeep, she is easily Open Lord Silverhand's *right hand*.

After dispensing with formalities, Silmerhelve got right down to business. Over the past month three shipments from Leilon and one from Waterdeep have gone missing. The last shipment from Leilon was accompanied by an escort made up of Leilon's new *militia*, the Sword of Leilon. So far, as many as 20 people have been lost from Leilon and six from Waterdeep. All considered dead.

Historically, she told them that the *Sword of Leilon* were a small adventuring company who made their name in Leilon, not unlike the Tavernlords. Those folk were long gone and risen to take on their moniker is a militia that has come up quickly and taken on an *official, unofficial role* similar to Waterdeep's City Watch. 

Leilon, which struggled after the magic plague, was in the midst of another recovery but still struggling, when Open Lord Dagult Neverember stepped in. He offered support of money and alliegences to both Neverwinter and Waterdeep. Over the past decade, Waterdeep, more than say Neverwinter, had taken a near-familial role with Leilon. *Sister-city* was how Silmerhelve referred to the city.

Travel along the High Road was sacrosanct. Considered safe passage by all, punishment for violating this principle has always been capital. Seen as a major thoroughfare through the region for both travelers and merchants, given the severity of the penalty, there was seldom been need for official escort or even sentries along the road.

There were two competing motivations that led Open Lord Silverhand to approve reaching out to the Tavernlords. First, no one wanted word of danger on the High Road to get out, especially unexplained danger. They had already sent out a team from Force Grey to investigate the Cassalanters'(a local noble family) lost cargo, from Waterdeep, and they turned up empty. Force Grey returned having tracked the caravan to High Road, just north of the lower range of the Sword Mountains. The heavy snowfall had made it easy for the team to follow the trail, even a week after the caravan had been assumed lost. To this end, the Tavernlords were to uncover the source of these raids and either put them to a stop or find their source and come back for reinforcements.

The second was a concern over some mumbling coming out of Leilon. Leilon was mostly secured and protected by a City Guard, but there has been talk lately about how the Sword of Leilon, that the barely recognized *militia*, little more than a glorified guild, was becoming more and more entwined with official business. And that was worrisome. Any information about The Sword that the Tavernlords could turn up would be rewarded.

Force Grey's report, investigating the missing cargo wagons, indicated that the Cassalanters's caravan was lost just beyond the Sword Mountain range, about three hours from the Carnath Roadhouse. The Tavernlords quickly came up with a plan, to disguise themselves and a wagon as more commerce, moving along the High Road, using themselves as bait.

The Magister offered them a wagon with the Cassalanters banners, to make them look like more enticing prey. She also proffered a few pieces of equipment that they thought might come in handy. For Erethil, the produced a magic quarterstaff; a magic bow for Sufari and a [Belt of Dwarvenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/belt-of-dwarvenkind) for the mighty Vold. Meanwhile, one of the House's server winged-monkeys, took a fondness for Grunddle and was allowed to accompany him on the journey.

Additionally, Silmerhelve gave Erethil 750 gold pieces, *traveling money* in case needs came up that money would help them solve better than *thunderwaves*. She oriented them to the **Carnath Roadhouse**, an old fort converted to a way-station for travelers along the High Road. She told them that it has long been a safe haven for anyone who entered, a place where everyone was free to stay for a night and could stay for additional days at a reasonable price. It was also a good source of local gossip and other useful information. She also warns that it is unsafe to travel with your mounts in the mere, but for a small fee, they can be boarded at the roadhouse. Assuming that you would need to spend some time in the mere, she also informed the team that there are rooms being held for them and their retainers at the **Weeping Willow Inn**, which is about a day's journey from the Roadhouse. 

Finally, she provides them with ***Limited* Writs of Parole and Authority** essentially deputizing them in the name of the Open Lord Laurel Silverhand. She told them: *If* you journey to Leilon, show your writs and announce your presence to the Office of the Leilon Guard.

They agreed to leave in the morning, giving the Guard time to put together the cargo and wagons that the Tavernlords requested and the wagoneers who would accompany them. In the end, it turned out that the Guard provided two junior swordsmen, who looked young (and inexperienced) enough to draw little attention for anyone stalking the caravan. Which, unfortunately, also meant that they were young and inexperienced.

## The road to the Mere of Dead Men

It was no surprise that the first six days of travel out of Waterdeep were uneventful. This was, after all the High Road. And there was unlikely to be too much trouble too close to Waterdeep and their City Guard, Griffon Riders and City Watch. Not to mention their countless lords and their various guild protectors.

Travel was cold, snowy and wet. In other words, miserable, For six days, they rode their horses or took turns sleeping in one of the wagons, as the caravan rolled on and on.

Sufari had been riding out front, as she often did. Vold was about twenty feet behind her, *wondering if he stopped right here, how much further could she go before she was out of range of his cleansing fire*... It was a game he thought that he was getting pretty good at, after six days of it. 

Suddenly, as they began heading up a slight uphill grade, two *clearly civilians* came running towards them frantically. Dressed in what was obviously merchant or some kind of traveler's garb, they appeared harried and beaten. They screamed for Sufari to turn back, as they ran towards her. Vold quickened his warhorse.

Sufari observed the two newcomers carefully, seeing no immediate danger as they approached, she reached back for her bow, just in case. Then she looked up, at the crest of the road she saw a strange light, multiple colors like a rainbow had exploded in one place, but was contained, writhing in some kind of agony. Moving towards this strange curtain? object? creature? was a wagon and a robed figure that stood on the bed, going through the cargo while an ogre pushed it with all it's might into the disturbing rainbow. An ogre, and a ***hill giant***, who had his mammoth backside planted against the wagon and was helping the ogre push it into the terrible breach in reality.

A hill giant, one of her mortal enemies. A hill giant, one of Vold's favorite foes. Sufari, dismounted and quickly began to sneak towards the giant, along the side of the road. Vold, charged his warhorse. As he drew closer, he noticed the wolf, actually two wolves on the field of battle, and one of them was heading right towards him. Without hesitation, he unleashed his new favorite *weapon* and hurled the mimic at their prey.

The mimic glanced off of the wolf and scuttled it a bit, but didn't stop it or cause any damage. The wolf snarled in anger. The mimic lay there, a menacing blob, shifting into some kind of spiked fence leaning towards the animal.

Sufari used her stealth to move over to a concealed position, where she was comfortable that she could attack the creature and applied her [hunter's mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark) and slayer's prey. She let loose an arrow and the battle began. Vold charged in on his horse, jumped off and attacked engaging his armblade morning star. The giant lashed out at Vold with a truncheon. And then suddenly the light and colors changed, a strange sound exploded through the air. Like a metal grinding against metal, screaming in a cacophony of sound. Grunddle didn't want to ride closer to the sound, but he did, finding a position opposite of Sufari and unleashed a [witch bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:witch-bolt) at the giant. Erethil, despite the horror in his ears and the mesmerizing cascade of color dismounted and strode purposefully to the a particular spot on the battlefield where he knelt and cast [animal friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) and charmed the wolves.

Grunddle's new flying-monkey friend, *"Bandit"*, went over to one of the bewitched wolves, the one who had been harassing the mimic. The mimic quickly leaped on the wolf's back and took the shape of saddle. Petting the animal to calm it, as the monkey jumped on the mimic's back and the three of them rode towards the combat.

More arrows, another morningstar attack from Vold and the giant fell on it's rear end swinging violently at the dragonborn. The mysterious...*chaos elemental*, was how Vold had begun to think about it, struck at him again. More light, more unnerving sound and the mighty Vold was also knocked off of his feet. Another burst of lights, this time at Sufari and she felt as if she had been seared in fire, a short burst of fire from... the *chaos elemental*, she thought. That's what it was called, that's what others called it anyway. *It knew that*.

Both back on their feet again, the giant towered over Vold, but they stood toe-to-toe exchanging blows. Erethil cast [moonbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam) on it, hailing down a silvery light that even cut through the brilliance of the lights radiating off the chaos elemental. The moonbeam burned into the giant, burning and burning. The radiance of it, engulfing the giant, searing it, but also keeping the others at bay, while Vold and the monster continued at one another in a violent crash of strength and steel. Vold unleashed his furious rage, howling as his beard began to grow in beneath his chin and his morningstar dug into the giant.

Finally one of the titans fell. A mighty blow from the giants club crumbled Vold to the cold ground, a bloody mess. The chaos elemental flooded the field with light again. Sufari nocked another arrow and finally took down the giant.

The chaos elemental moved towards the rest of the team. Grunddle cast an [illusory blitz](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/worlds-almanac/spells/illusory-blitz.md#illusory-blitz) which he hollered out as a "Beam of order, to contain the chaos!" and a series of small boxes, dozens and dozens of them flew towards the chaos elemental and began encasing it's light. It writhed in agony.

It lashed out again, this time at Erethil and Sufari again. Again burning Sufari and this time *refreshing* Erethil? And caught in the light at his feet, the mighty dragon stirred, then pushed himself, incredibly, back to his feet. Grunddle cast his powerful illusion again with bigger boxes this time, causing the elemental to contract and expand rapidly. The sound that it was producing was growing louder and louder, stranger and stranger. Like the screams of animals mixed with the grinding of old gears.

Then, before it could strike again, near dead and angrier than he has felt in years, Vold turned his wrath towards the chaos elemental and unleashed his fiery breath weapon, ending the battle. 

The elemental seemed burst into small flames, along some broken fragments of color and light. It grew brighter and became a blinding light, around the edge of the creature. The light froze, like a frame - broken and fragmented, for the first time since they lay eyes on it, it became completely still. 

And quiet. An almost deafening silence filled the road. And then it was gone. An acrid smell like the combination of sulfur and lightning surrounded them. 

Vold looked around for something else to smash. But there was nothing. The wagon was gone, the mysterious figure on top of it and the ogre pushing it, all went through the chaos elemental almost before the battle had begun. 

They looked around, just like the other report from Force Grey, there was indeed the signs of a struggle, but no cargo and no wreckage and the only victim was the giant. A creature unlikely to be felled by less competent defenders.

The Tavernlords inspected the area, aside from the giant, there was truly nothing to be found. On the giant however, Erethil found clumps of moss and mud, jammed between the creatures bare toes. A clear sign that it had been tromping around the mere.

Six days on the road and they had picked up two refugee merchants and two wolves (at least temporarily). Six days and they knew... or at least had an idea of what had happened to the wagons, even if they didn't really have any clue of what they had actually seen. 

*Some folk might have turned back with what they knew and turned it over to the Guard, but not these folk.* They knew that they had only scratched the surface. And Erethil, Vold and Sufari, who had been touched, attacked by the chaos elemental, *had a hunger*. A hunger to know more about the elemental, the inexplicable knowledge that there are more of them out there. And they were going to be trouble... *right*...?

Thinking about the impending menace of the chaos elemental, Erethil looked at Vold, whom he could have sworn was dead, *right*...
