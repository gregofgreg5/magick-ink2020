## It's a trap
When we last left our intrepid heroes they had just dispatched a goblin ambush and breached the lair. While Erethil and Sufari checked out the other door and the rest of the room, Vold went over to check the chest in the corner. Vold and the mimic attempted to pry it open, only to have the floor fall into pieces below them. Vold and Grunddle fell 25 feet into a pit. As the trap tripped an alarm blasted through the compound. 

The team rallied around their *fallen* comrades. Vold, however needed no help (well, no help that he hadn't brought with him!). Vold had the mimic form a makeshift climbing mat and it pressed against the wall. Vold stuck his mighty hands and feet into it and the two of them scaled the side of the pit. 

Grunddle was preparing a spell, when Erethil shifted into his enormous spider-form and fired a web down to his mates. Grunddle, wisely saved his magic and used the butt-web to climb out.

Meanwhile, Sufari stalked out the door, waiting for anyone to crash through. But the gob raiders spilled into the room too quickly and the battle was on. Bandits poured into the room and blades flashed and swirled around the small (40x40) confines. To make matters worse, the vilains began to pour in before the two Tavernlords were able to get out of the pit and the pit took up half of the room!

Soon the heroes were surrounded by tide after tide of goblins and *bullywugs*?!?Indeed goblins and bullywugs were clearly allied and operating as a team. These brigands were joined by two ogres. One that actually leapt into the pit to begin it's attacks.

The criminals put up a good fight, but were ultimately dipatched. Erethil took down one of the goblins. Sufari's aim was deadly, slaying a gob, a bullywug and the goblin leader. The mimic took down a bullywug. But it was Grunddle's [*illusory blitz*](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/homebrew/spells/illusory-blitz.md#illusory-blitz) that really stole the show, devastating two gobs and an ogre.

The last ogre, who had once again jumped into the pit, seeing the rest of the squad defeated, surrendered. 

When the Tavernlords finished clearing the room, they found a final gob, cowering in the corridor. 

The rest of the the compound was fairly simple. This was a place where the raiding parties would bunker down, stash their treasure and then go back out for more ill-gotten gains.

The brigands had been gathered in the larger hall behind the door, where they spent more of their time when in the compound. The other two rooms were filled with loot. 

The gob prisoner told them that they'd better clear out, as raiding parties arrived frequently throughout the day and night. And any day now they were expecting one of the warchiefs to come back to collect the rest of the loot.

## The Loot
There was a surprising huge haul of treasure and equipment in the two rooms. 

>1,200 gold pieces
2,500 silver pieces
Gemstones:
25 alexandrite
10 azurite
15 blue quartz
1 jasper
an ***abacus, all-purpose tool +1*** (Grunddle)
an ***amulet of agile dragons*** (Vold)
an ***austere Earing of Solace*** (Erethil)
a pair of ***boots of striding and springing*** (Vold)
the ***Hunter's bracer of thorns*** (Sufari)
two potions of climbing (Sufari/Vold)
four potions of healing (Grunddle)
and a scroll of enlarge/reduce (Grunddle)
and Kisri's second Tome

## Aftermath
At the end of the raid on the outpost the Tavernlords had a gob and ogre prisoner, a treasure horde and at least one mystery.

* Were the the bullywugs and Fat Cobra's goblins working together?
>Previous intelligence had suggested that the bullywug, while sometimes numerous were less than organized and not really a threat.

* What happened to the other tomes and Kisri's amulet?
* It seems like there are more of these little outposts out there. So just where is Fat Cobra?


## And most importantly, where to next?
* Back to the Weeping Willow to return the tome?
* West Harbor?
* Try to hunt down another outpost?
* Or...?



*Fat Cobra is waiting*
