## Tyna's Blessing
**Tyr's Burden, *circa -750 DR***

The first few days of his stay in Tyr's Burden was a whirlwind of confusion and adjustment. Even his time in the City Guard had not prepared Grosh for the... *intimacy* of this small hamlet. Everyone here was so familiar with one another, so personal, not at all a way-of-life that he was at all accustomed.

It didn't take long for word to spread that the strangers were not a traveling band of minstrels, but rather a troupe of mercenary heroes. A band that was more than happy to take food and lodging as a retainer to defend the town against the recent orc raids.

Grosh and his fellow members of Force Grey were an eclectic bunch, even for *modern Waterdeep*: a half-elf, a strange dwarf, a tiefling and of course a minotaur, Grosh himself. Each, on their own, may not have stood out against the diverse population of Waterdeep, but here, amongst the mostly human and halfling background they were the unmistakable, center of attention for the first few days in town. 

While he was sometimes awkward, the friendly and welcoming people of Tyr's Burden embraced him and were excited to hear about his adventures in the Guard and with Force Grey. 

For such a small town, there seemed to be a never-ending line of names and faces and things to remember about the people of Tyr's Burden. Grosh did his best, but by the third day, when he mistook the Mayor for his brother the cleric, he was sure he would never get the hang of this. *Whose idea was it to go through that portal, anyway...? Oh yeah...*

Grosh was sitting in his favorite spot in Tyr's Burden, under a large tree, having his lunch of apples and cheese, when Tyna Wildheart and a dwarf whom he hadn't met yet (or at least didn't remember meeting) approached him. Cordially, she *re-introduced herself*, the archdruid of the hamlet, she actually scoffed at the formal title and said "if the wild had wanted me to have a title, the winds would carry it in their song of her, and told him that she could just call her *Tyna*." She also introduced her companion, covered in soot, grime and no doubt bits of everything in his workshop, **Daerin** was obviously one of the dwarven smiths who had relocated to the hamlet from Melairbode. There weren't very many dwarves in Tyr's Burden, but they provided a service that tripled the value of the hamlet's material output, in addition to keeping the town supplied with their goods. They were, in their own way, as respected as the Town Council.

Tyna went on to explain to Grosh that since the orc raids began she had been seeking the counsel of the Wild. At first she prayed that the Wild would tame the orcs or at least move them on from Tyr's Burden. After the third raid, she began to pray for whatever help the Wild could give the town. It was a few days after that, in one of her walks she discovered the most amazing thing. 


She had found it seemingly buried into the side of a hillside. She found it by chance, leaning on it, while investigating a flora beside it. She leaned on it and found metal. Carefully she unearthed it until she was sure what she had found. At first she had thought it was a person, or given that it was buried, standing upright, probably what was left of a person. But once she confirmed it was empty, she knew what it was. It was the answer to her prayers.

Tyna returned to the hamlet and brought back Constable Stratford and Daerin, whom she would know would know how to remove it from the hill and transport it safely. The Tyna and the Constable, and later the Council, all agreed that it was to be left in her care. Especially since it was way too large to fit anyone who currently resided in Tyr's Burden. Not even Curate Harper could find much footing arguing that the armor was not sent for her to find, after all, he probably would have made the same claim!

Her heart leapt when Tyna saw Grosh, she knew that he would be the one. Still she waited a few days, watching, listening and even talking to him occasionally, before she knew that he was indeed, the one!

Daerin and Tyna helped fit Grosh into the beautiful, gigantic platemail. To no one's surprise, it fit perfectly!

Grosh spent the rest of the week working with Constable Stratford, priming the hamlet's defenses and working on training with the deputies. Tyna kept a close eye on him and quickly became one of his favorite people in the small town.
