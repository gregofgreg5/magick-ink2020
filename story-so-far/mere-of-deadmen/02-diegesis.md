# The Diegesis Adventure
## May 5, 2021 - December 15, 2021
Lee Dohm (*Isarav*), Andy Smith (*Harriet* & *Shiluo*), Carter Smith (*Remeele*)

* **Harriet** (aarakocra) was a scholar at the (Diegesis) College of Westgate, was on a detail examining artifacts and relics recovered along the Sword Coast. A wizard by training, she recognized some familiar symbols on a staff. 
	* She had seen the symbols in the journal of the legendary adept apprentice, **Tal** who had been mentored by **Einrich**, one of the most prestigious adepts of all time.
	* Harriet remembered a note, a crude sketch in the margin Tal's journal that matched carvings that she had found on the staff. The notes referenced the ancient ruins of the Temple of Ramenos in the Mere of Dead Men.
	* The Diegesis was anxious to have a team go out and investigate the ruins to provide more modern data that might match up to Einrich's last journals which recently were discovered in Leilon.
* **Remeele** (Elf) was a famous bard, who along with her partner Alorha (a female dwarf) were a renown mercenary team that traveled up and down the Sword Coast adventuring. Their legend, ever-spreading (mostly told by Remeele herself) the two were quite popular, until Alorha was killed. Remeele, a little beset and feeling lost, turned to the sea in order to turn the page and look for a new story in which to participate.
* **Shiluo de Lung** is from the *T'u Long *region, where he studied at the local Diegesis college. When Shiluo was about to begin his career as an adept of the order, tragedy struck. Without explanation, he and others were evacuated from the college just before raiders descended on it, razing the buildings, burning the library and books, and killing all that remained. They would later learn that the Diegesis was forewarned of the attack and had secretly relocated the library's most precious tomes and scholars weeks ahead of the raid. Those that had remained at the school were volunteers and retirees who sacrificed themselves to keep the secret library safe and make the attackers believe that they had accomplished their nefarious goal. Some of those evacuated traveled to other colleges to continue their study, but most drifted out into the world to seek other fortunes.
* Shiluo found his way to the coast, embraced life as a sailor, and found what he believed to be his true calling as a wanderer of the seas. Though Shiluo has not adopted a new College, he is willing to give safe harbor and training to young adepts that find him.
* **Irasav** (bronze dragonborn) is an adept monk from the Diegesis College in Westgate, who had until very recently been traveling back East. An experienced adept and master of martial arts, he is already in his sixties (dragonborn typically live to about 80), he has had a career that has covered ground from the Sword Coast to Murgh√¥m and points in-between.

## The mystery
* **Einrich** was a renown Diegesis scholar who became a legendary adept. The long-lived elf, spent over five hundred years building a career exploring and adventuring up and down the Sword Coast. The Diegesis already had eight Books of Einric when he disappeared. And there were dozens of other Books from adepts who encountered him in their journeys and even a few who shared adventures with him.
	* His work informed a legion of scholars and gave rise to hundreds of lines of research across the Colleges. His disappearance rocked the Academy. Einric and Tal, his most recent apprentice, had been exploring landmarks in the Mere of Deadmen for almost a hundred years.
* **Tal**. Before she was Einrich's last apprentice, she was an accomplished scholar and burgeoning adept. A long-lived elf, like his mentor, they had worked together for almost a century, and it wasn't uncommon for the two of them to be gone for months. But 70 years ago the two legends disappeared. At the time, Tal's journals were recovered, but not Einrich's.
* **Einrich's Journals** 
	* Diegesis adepts and scholars all journal their experiences and observations. Many of these are transcribed into more permanent *Books* and archived in the Diegesis. Journals are often more *raw* notes and are often introspective.
* About a year before this adventure starts, an adept in Leilon reported to the Academy that she believed that she had recovered equipment that may have belonged to an adept and he continued to scour the area and eventually found three tomes hidden a cave, concealed, buried in a wall: Einric's last journals. In them, she recounted that the two legendary adepts had indeed found something astonishing.
	* A veteran adept, Eklas Kisri and two couriers were dispatched at once to retrieve the tomes. Shortly after they took possession of the tomes, trouble began along the High Road between Leilon and Waterdeep, where they were expected to book passage on a ship back to Westgate. However, not wanting to risk the raiders, and being experienced travelers in the Mere, Kisri felt the safer choice would be to travel off of the beaten path. 
	* As word grew that travel along the High Road was getting more dangerous, Kisri decided to forgo their plans to depart from Waterdeep and make for the closer port at West Harbor. It was en route to West Harbor that they were ambushed. One of the couriers was slain. Kisri and the other barely escaped with their lives, but they had lost the precious tomes.

## Mere of Deadmen: Arrival at the Mere
* **Shiluo** served as one of the Ship's *Sea Masters* on the ***Admiral's Yalman***, the vessel which **Irasav** had also signed on to a few years before.
* They picked up **Remeele** and **Harriet** at Westgate.
* The four of them took a dinghy to the Mere, at the shore of the Temple of Ramenos, with plans to meet the Yalman at West Harbor in 15 days. The Yalman would wait two days and then continue on their way, to return two months later to pick-up **Shiluo** (and **Irasav**).

![Image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/chester-sm.jpg?raw=true)
* Their first encounter was a ***Chester***, a magnificent tree that loomed in the middle of the clearing, speaking to them in a booming, friendly voice, it warned them that death lay ahead and offers to tell them one truth each - that he is incapable of lying or telling half-truths.
	* He tells Irasav that the best way to meet their goals would be to turn back, but if they insisted on moving forward, that they should trust nothing else in the Mere, other than itself.
	* It told Harriet that the best route to the temple ruins.
	* Shiluo it warned that danger lurked behind every branch and bubbling swamp and still water. It warned of traps and foes at every turn.
	* It told Remeele that bullywugs are always going back and forth, but there have been other *miscreants* with them lately.
* In the glade that separated Chester, the talking tree, and the ruins they encountered a more vicious giant sentient tree and seven bullywugs and their batrachi leader.

	* Remeele dispensed with he wugs with a hypnotic pattern spell.
	* And for the first time in a century, a batrachi was found on the material plane.
	* Batarchi were legendary servants of the deity Ramenos who vanished when their liege was banished.

**Batrachi**
## Ruins of the Temple of Ramenos
* The area immediately around the ruins had a more dense atmospheric pressure. 
* The most remarkable parts of the ruins were a large stone arch and a stone-ringed (empty) pool beside it.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/temple-of-ramenos.jpg?raw=true)
* As **Harriet** and the staff drew closer to the temple, the pressure abated and the air began to become moist. And as the team moved into the ruins, the long-gone ancient walls of the temple began to materialize around them and the revived temple filled with marsh water.
* The large archway on the opposite side of the ruins, had become a doorway, opened not to the mere, but appeared to open to an *endless sea*. And the pool was filled with clear liquid, with a white cloudy layer a few feet beneath the surface.
* The mysterious *caretaker*, a bullywug? batrachi? appeared and told them that Ramenos was awaiting to return and talked them into putting the staff in the pool. When **Harriet** did surrender the staff to the pool, the temple vanished in a whirl of sound and visions. These images (and sounds) unfolded before them:
	* A pitched battle at the Weeping Willow Inn, but it looks like the bad guys (some goblins and strange warriors are taking the inn).
 	* A shinning army is mounting.
 	* Shadow falls from Waterdeep across the Sword Coast until it engulfs Leilon and continues towards Neverwinter.
 	* In the mere, there is a large black willow that flashes with brilliant colors on a dark background. The colored lights flash like explosions, changing their hue and brightness randomly, chaotically.
 	* The vision pans from the tree, continuing in the mere... to what appears to be a rudimentary graveyard. Behind it are  stones that look like the temple ruins. Suddenly in the foreground, moving towards the stones, a handful of undead are gathering and appear to be heading towards the ruins. 
 	* It looks like water rushing through a tunnel, emerging in a building that looks a lot like the temple that they were just in, but in a very different shape. The room appears to be lined with strange archways, *portals*... and in the background, a large... *frog-shape* could be seen forming...
* At a crossroads, the team found themselves in the middle of a mystery that the had not quite expected. It isn't very often that these kind of missions turn out to be something active.
* They decided that they should travel to the Illefarn Portal Ruins, another of the ancient site that Einrich and **Tal** had been investigating.

## Traveling to the Illefarn Portals 
 * With no direct route from the ruins of the temple to the ruins of the portals, the team decided to take a more dangerous, but shorter and more direct route through the Mere to get to the High Road.
 * Along the way they were ambushed by a team of yuan-ti and a giant alligator which they defeated, but when they investigated the strange multi-colored gem on the alligator, it unleashed a wave of chaos energy.
	* **Remeele** and **Shiluo** both grew to nine feet tall
	* **Irasav** became more sturdy
	* **Harriet** died a couple times, came back and she began to hear strange voices...
	* Once they recovered their wits, the again made haste to the High Road. Along the way becoming aware that they were being followed.
	* Upon reaching the road, **Shiluo** summone da camel mount for him and **Remeele**, **Irasav** who could on this terrain move much more swiftly and **Harriet** again took to the wing and they advanced double-time down the High Road, leaving behind a lone yuan-ti stalker.
* Their planned layover at the Carnath Roadhouse was derailed. They discovered that the Sword of Leilon had taken over and closed the "always open to everyone" way-station.
	* They were allowed to continue on their way once the Sword determined that Irsav was not the bronze dragon, *Vold*, that they were looking for.

## Approaching Illefarn
* The Illefarn Portals ruins were less *ruins* and more a historic location. All that remained of the ruins were a few stones on top of a plateau. *Or so anyone has believed for centuries*.
* Upon arriving at the base of the plateau they found a camp that had been beset upon by demonic raiders: an Armanite commanding three gnolss and two quasits, whom they had to dispatch. 

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/illefarn-camp-sm.jpg?raw=true)

* The encampment was littered with dozens of crates and boxes of loot hijacked from the High Road robberies. There were also the slaughtered bodies of a dozen bullywugs, five yuan-ti, two batrachi and a few more gnoll corpses.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/armanite.png?raw=true) **Armanite**
* They interrogated their gnoll prisoner, using *Charm Person* and were able to find out that the raiding party had come from *The Seeping Woods* (Yeenogough's domain), through a portal that they stumbled upon. A portal on top of the plateau.
* Careful consideration led them to deduce that the the wugs, yuan-ti and batrachi were responsible for the trouble on the High Road. 

## The Illefarn Portals
* At the top of the plateau, they found the familiar stones arrayed the site but also a stone arch and pool, like the one that they had seen at the Ramenos ruins.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/illefarn-top-sm.jpg?raw=true)

* In the pool was the same clear liquid, with a murky cloud of white beneath the surface.
* Inside the portal they peered into a subterranean landscape that hadn't seen the surface of the material plane for centuries.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/illefarn-entry.jpg?raw=true)
* A lush green, forested area with a steep set of stairs leading down to a small stone, ornamental building and then continuing down into a cavernous wilderness.
	* A stream, apparently some kind of mountain run-off, stalactites and stalagmites through the cavern. They even saw strange, unidentifiable flying creatures in the cavern above.
* Inside the building the team found what was once the engine that powered the famed Illefarn Portals.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/illefarn-portals-sm.jpg?raw=true)

* Guarding the portals were two batrachi ("Galungorm" and "Cyan'dar") and two yuan-ti, shapeshifted to appear like elves. Three of them were dispatched and the fourth, a yuan-ti, escaped through one of the portals.
* There were two portals and a door. Through one portal they could see what looked like the ruins of the Temple of Ramenos (that they had just left). The one that the yuan-ti ran through looked out into a dark field, filled with some kind of mist with various shapes moving around in the fog.
* **Remeele**, attached to a tether, went through to the Temple ruins, where she found everything much like they had left it. *Bravely* she dipped her hand into the pool and it killed her, her life essence drew out of her like it was running through a drain. The team pulled her through and helped her recover. Returned to life, she found herself changed, her body aging backwards through time. In her early thirties when the entered the portal, when she awoke her body, had regressed to the age of 14.
* After careful consideration, they decided it was too scary to go after the yuan-ti and opened the door. The door led to a dark circular room, in which the door that they had come through was free-standing in the center. Even after careful inspection, there were no other exits from the room.
* **Irasav** quickly deduced that if the door was pushed open it opened to the Illefarn engine, but if it were pulled open, it opened into a hallway. In the hallway they found three large humanoid-wolf creatures and quickly dispatched two of them and **Remeele** charmed the third.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/wolfkind-warrior.png?raw=true)
* They discovered that they were at the top layer of tower with a walkway that led to an exit. The walkway was suspended, in fact it appeared that the whole circular corridor and the room were on some kind of platform that hung above the same brilliant, flashing explosion of colorful lights that they had seen in the mere on the giant snake and on the ceiling of the Illefarn engine. Strikingly absent though was the horrific sounds that had accompanied the other appearances. From their vantage point it looked like they were about 50-70 feet above the floor below. 

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fort-06-tower.jpg?raw=true)

## The Tavernlords! Papyrus! AJ Frost! Oh My!

* On the other side of the door across the walkway, they found themselves on the top level of the Admiral's Foot, the fortress that was one of the first permanently established locations in the Mere.
* In the courtyard below them there was a strange combination of half-orc and halfling guards milling about.
* They decided to head to what looked like a security station on the other side of the fort. They took their captured/charmed wolf-creature and quickly took command of the room. The station had two catapults and two cast-iron vats of red sand, over burning coals, poised to be dumped on would-be invaders. In the opposite corner of the room was a stack of hay bales and a large barrel of some kind of obviously flammable goop. 
* Beneath them, **Taklak and Stupid** set the horses free and set fire to the stables.
* **Erethil**, who had wild-shaped into a swarm of bees,  saw Remeele, who looked like a young girl, and went to offer assistance.  
* **Vold** discovered that he had a telepathic link with Xzet hatched plan for the Mimic to escape into the courtyard and for the Tavernlords to rescue it.
* **Sufari**, **Vold** and **Tal** set fire to the hay bundles that Diegesis had thrown out of the building, at the front gates and then snuck in.
* The battle was joined. A few soldiers from the Sword of Leilon attacked the security building. Half-orc guards closed from the other side of the building.
* **Xzet** got held up when it ran into AJ Frost meeting with a batrachi flanked by several yuan-ti and a small shimmering chaos elemental. The creatures were demanding that Frost send more men to help their cause, saying that their mission had been a success but that the *universe was hemorrhaging and needed to be contained*. Carefully, Xzet followed them as Frost directed them out of the office.

## Papyrus!
* Before the two teams could really even properly become acquainted all hell broke loose when the Chaos Elemental that had been lurking around burst loose a giant unspeakable behemoth, which we shall call *Papyrus*.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/papyrus.jpg?raw=true)
* A mass of mouths, tentacles and otherworldly ooze, the creature stood over sixty feet tall and it's indescribable wail drove some to madness.
* The halfling guards rushed to *make sure the stabled horses*, while most of the half-orcs were frozen in fear, some ran to get help and others tried in vain to fight the monster.
* *The monster* was remarkable, it was some kind of nightmare that none of the adventurers had ever seen or heard of before. Even the four diegesis adepts who had spent most of their lives studying the eldritch, bizarre and interplanar. It wasn't easy, but they still killed it.
## AJ Frost & Bug
* Having watched the group clear out *Papyrus*, AJ Frost and a company of well-armed creatures of his own, including a handful of half-orcs, a few soldiers from the Sword of Leilon, a kobold assassin (*Grimmoth*) from the Zentharim, **Bug**, one of Fat Cobra's main henchmen and three of the undead samurai creatures (Shadoukenku, Hi no shi no Zugaikotsu and Ken ga ≈ç sugiru).
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/grey%20bug.jpg?raw=true)
* While Frost evoked a red haze of rage in Vold, the most dire threat was Bug and his massive hammer, which Shiluo found out the hard way was capable of turning it's victims to stone!
* The vast size of the compound proved another challenge for the teams as their opponents were 40 some feet below them or spread hundreds of feet away on the other side of the building (Frost & Grimmoth).
* Erethil and Harriet engaged the villains on the other side of the compound, taking down the kobold assassin, **Grimmoth**. 
* Taklak took the unconventional approach of leaping off the building and [*lightning lured*](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-lure) Frost with him, trying to deliver the meatbag to Vold. The only flaw in his plan was killing Frost in the fall!
* The rest of the villains fell in short order, with **Bug** left as the last menace standing. He tried to give the Tavernlords & Diegesis team the opportunity to surrender to inevitable reinforcements from Fat Cobra, but he was dispatched by **Shiluo**.

* **Doggo**, a mechanical construct, had come through the Chaos Elemental. After a careful examination, **Grunddle** suggested that it was a [*Steel Defender*][link](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/steel-defender), but it was a strange design and it looked like it had many, many years of wear. Maybe even hundreds of years, he was surprised it still functioned. 
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/doggo.jpg?raw=true)
* **Grunddle's** inspection activated a recorded message:

>Whoever receives this message. There is a terrible alliance that must be stopped at all costs. It endangers all of Faerun, perhaps the entire plane of existence. Batrachi have returned and have a legion of bullywugs, they are allied with Yuan-ti, and have awakened the ancient, deity **Ramenos**.
>It appears that they have opened a rupture in the universe and unspeakable creatures... oh, creatures beyond the imagination are manifest. Even in their great numbers, the batrachi and their allies are over-matched, but the damage is done. They have awakened the sleeping Ramenos and torn a hole in the sky, unleashing who knows what.
>There is a portal at the Tower of Darkness that leads to ***Smaragd***, beneath the giant's skeleton. I believe that there are more of them on the other side... Smaragd. They must be stopped.
>Do not go to West Harbor for aid or succor, they are also aligned with this dark menace. I know not their intentions, but the authorities at Waterdeep or Leilon should be made to know of their conspiracy with this.
>I am **Einrich**, an adapt from the Diegesis of Westgate. I have been mortally wounded and these are my final words.
* The looming darkness and foreboding shapes moving in the sky filled them with dread, but it was decided that they needed to follow-up on Einrich's message and investigate the Illefarn Portals (his last known location) and seek out whatever was happening in the East... where the *monstrosity had come from*.
* The teams re-traced the Diegesis team's route back into the tower, over **the strange chasm of chaos** and through the free-standing doorway.
* They found the Illefarn Portal Engine much like the Diegesis team had left it. One portal still looked out on to the ruins of the Temple or Ramenos at the north of the Mere. The other was dark and full of shadow, with strange movement in the mist on the other side. This portal was the one that the surviving yuan-ti escaped through.
* Outside the Engine, they found the eldritch forest still thriving could see the doorway that lead to the top of the Illefarn Portals ruins.
