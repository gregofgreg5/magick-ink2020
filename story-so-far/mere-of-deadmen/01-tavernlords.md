# The Mere of Dead Men
## February 17, 2021 - December 15, 2021
Lee Dohm (*Erethil* & *Tal*), Donavan Hoepcke (*Vold & Xzet*), Andy Smith (*Grunddle, Taklak, Stupid*) and Carter Smith (*Sufari*)
## The Mission
* Travel along the High Road between Waterdeep and their *sister city* Leilon has been disrupted by a series of brazen raids. Typically safe, travel along the High Road is considered sacrosanct, with the most severe penalties. An initial, cursory, Force Grey investigation has indicated that the bandits are likely coming from the Mere of Deadmen.
	* The Mere of Deadmen is a vast wetland with a sinister legacy of darkness and mystery. Few permanent, hospitable settlements or structures exist in the Mere.

* Through the Tavernlords *Frontier* contact, **Jubble Excelon**, the Lords of Waterdeep & a consortium of local merchants have requested assistance in putting an end to these raids.
* Lodging had been established for the Tavernlords at the Weeping Willow Inn, which can also be used as a base of operations as they explore the Mere.
## First Encounter
* On the High Road, the Tavernlords encountered a caravan that had been waylayed by bandits! Led by a *mysterious hooded figure*, an ogre, two wolves and a hill giant were apparently trying to push one of the wagons into what looked like a giant tear in the universe, filled with all the colors imaginable dancing an unholy dance around each other to the most horrific combination of sounds imaginable. They were able to defeat the ogre, giant and wolves, but the mysterious figure was able to escape with the wagon, traveling into the maelstrom of color and sound.
* While the others were policing the area, **Sufari** venutred ahead to scout the road. When she saw a wagon just off the road, she set off into the Mere to investigate. But when she got there she was ambushed by a handful of goblins. She handled most of them easily, as if they she were shooting *Tavernlords in a barrel*, but the squad leader stopped her in her tracks when it pulled out a strange ball of yarn and tossed it at her. It exploded, she *fell fast asleep* and she was taken prisoner!
* Unable to locate their missing companion, they assumed that she had gone ahead without them and continued on to...

## Carnath Roadhouse
* The Carnath Roadhous is regarded as the *midway point* between Leilon and Waterdeep along the High Road and is renown for being a *safe haven for everyone*: a sort of sanctuary if you will.
	* While the clientele is mostly limited to travelers along the High Road, the occasional Mere resident has been known to slither or crawl in to the fort as well. 
	* The Roadhouse was owned and operated by **Bog Luck**, who is best known for the card game that he *invented*. The Tavernlords made fast friends with Luck, **Andrew Briferhew** (his chief of security) and **Gristle Pete** (the Roadhouse cook).
* The Tavernlords also met a mercenary group that operated mostly by providing safe passage in and around the Mere, that was made up of a dwarf, **Kerehle**; two elves: **Laura** and **Moeh**; and a gnome named **Shep**. Two of them had just arrived, having chased off a small band of kobolds, who left behind a still-sleeping **Sufari**!
* At the Roadhouse, the Tarvernlords learned that the giants and their cousin ogres have been reported more frequently along the High Road, something that hasn't been common in over two decades.
* Bullywugs, an all too common general nuisance in the Mere have also become much more brazen and bold within the swampier areas.
* Briferhew told the Tavernlords that there have been more Zhent agents and known conspirators moving through the Roadhouse lately, but he doubts that they are involved with the ogres & giants, mostly they have just been traveling the High Road.
* When they left Waterdeep, they were told that Leilon had no real standing army, but had a *small militia*, the *Sword of Leilon* that has apparently grown in number. The Sword of Leilon was named after a small group of adventuring heroes who protected the up & coming city. Now mostly plate-clad soldiers, the Sword of Leilon have been seen in small groups, presumably patrolling the High Road.
* No one knew anything about the *Chaos Elemental* that the Tavernlords had encountered.

## Weeping Willow Inn
* Laura and Kerehle escorted the Tavernlords to the Weeping WIllow.
* At the Weeping Willow they met **Lady Grace** (elf) who owned the Inn and **Rockhound** (Dwarf) the general all around guy around the Inn. Grace, her late husband and Rockhound had been adventurers, who purchased the Inn and retired here.
* The Inn, another one of the few *civilized safe places* in the Mere was protected by three ogres: **Bear, Chick and Lev,** who were friends of the owners who they had met during their careers and had remained close.

* The previous day, the ogres had rescued **Eklas Kisri** (halfling Diegesis adept) and **Riziasi** (tabaxi Diegesis adept), who had been brought in near death. 
	* Still not quite road ready, Kisri explained that she and her team had been on a mission to recover three tomes. They were attacked by goblins who stole a pendant with a large ruby and inset diamonds and emeralds around the frame and the three tomes. She was desperate to get them back and promised a reward for their return.
* The team met **AJ Frost**, clearly a professional, likely some kind of mercenary or *sell-sword*, who had been at the Inn waiting for some associates.

* A casual discussion around the bar suggested that the goblins belonged to Fat Cobra, a dwarf who ran a *small time* crime syndicate around the Mere. Frost told them that for a cut of their earnings that he would lead them to a know den of Fat Cobras, not more than a day away.
## Fat Cobra's Den
* AJ Frost showed the Tavernlords a *known secret*, and revealed that there were hidden glyphs on many trees and larger fixtures in Mere, these glyphs seemingly direct travelers to various locations, fascilitating safe travel through the quagmire.
* Frost lead the team to a glade, where he pointed out a trap door hidden beneath a fallen tree, telling them that this was one of Fat Cobra's stashes. And then left them. 
* Before they entered the glade, the Tavernlords staked it out and realized that they have been lead into an ambush. There were several goblins hiding around the glade waiting for victims to wander to their stash. *Or they'd been set up!*
* After dispatching the would-be assassins they found more goblins and a couple of ogres inside the den guarding a few rooms of stolen loot, including one of the Diegesis tomes.

## Ambush: Part Two and Three
* Having taken a little longer than they had planned dealing with the ogres and a pit, they emerged to find another group of goblins had arrived to drop off their ill-gotten goods. Discovering that their lair was violated, they also took up position around glade.
	* Another ball of *sleepy yarn* and a pretty nifty illusion that made it look like there were more of them than there were only prolonged the goblins inevitable defeat.
* Leaving the glade, they discovered that trick that Frost had shown them didn't work! The Tavernlords hunkered down for the night only to be ambushed again the next morning!
* This time the villains were able to get the drop on them traveling through a Chaos Elemental and were made up of bullywugs, a flaming skull (***Hi no shi no Zugaikotsu***) and a claw-toothed raptor.
* The raptor escaped through the Elemental and when **Vold** rode **Erethil** (transformed into a Giant Toad) followed him, they found themselves outside of the Weeping Willow Inn, which was clearly under siege. 
* 
## The Fall of the Weeping Willow & Captured!

* **Taklak** and **Stupid** joined the team, in absolute awe of the Mighty **Vold**.
* The Tavernlords found two of the ogres dead. The marauders were led by **Harry Stamph** (the son of Lady Grace) was made up of goblins, ogres and two more *samurai*: *Shadoukenku* and *Ken ga ō sugiru*.
	* Stamph and the villains had already killed Grace and dealt the Rockhound a near fatal wound when the Tavernlords arrived.
* Minutes after the Tavernlords cleared out Stamph and his creatures, they found themselves surrounded by a battalion of soldiers in gleaming platemail, trimmed in gold: ***The Sword of Leilon!***

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/sword-logo-framed-sm.jpg?raw=true)
* The Sword had already captured AJ Frost and took the Tavernlords into *protective custody* and frog-marched them towards West Harbor. All of the Tavernlords excpet for **Erethil**, who had wild-shaped himself into a warhorse and was taken along with the rest.
* **Xzet**, the mimic, turned into a shield and secreted away the tome. The shield was taken with the warhorse and the rest of the equipment that the Sword found around the Inn.

## Fat Cobra revealed
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fc-compund-sm.jpg?raw=true)
* The Sword arrived at ***The Admiral's Foot***, a fort-like compound about half a days trek from West Harbor.
	* The Admiral's Foot was the first settlement on the Mere. It has since been a base of operations for building West Harbor, a fort during the *War with the Black Death* (against the black dragon, Voaraghamanthar, and his legion of lizardfolk), and has most recently been a militia compound and prison for West Harbor. 
* The compound was guarded by patrols of halflings, the predominant race in West Harbor, half-orcs and goblins.
* The Sword of Leilon led their prisoners to ***Wesley Whitetail***, the Praetor of West Harbor, who stood revealed to be the notorious **Fat Cobra**. 
	* Fat Cobra, who had been using the Admiral's Foot has his own base of operations of late.

* There were two more of the strange samurai: ***Doragon'naito, Naitosutōkā*** in Fat Cobra's entourage and it was revealed that AJ Frost had been working with the Sword of Leilon and Fat Cobra all along!
* While the Tavernlords were being disarmed, **Taklak** and **Stupid** made a break for it, tunneling away to relative safety!
* The rest of the Tavernlords (**Grunddle**, **Sufari** and **Vold**) were stripped of their gear and taken into the compound and then down into the small, dark prison below.

## The Prison
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/fc-prison-escape-start.JPG?raw=true)
* The Tavernlords were escorted under the compound to a dark, cold, damp prison.
* * The eight cells are guarded by two goblins, two half-orc guards and two half-orc guard captains. 
* The **Sufari**, **Vold** and **Grunddle** were spaced out so that none of them were directly next to or across from one another.
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/tal-sm.jpg?raw=true)
* In the cell at the end of the block was **Tal**
	* **Tal** is a 279-year old elf adept from the Diegesis Academy in Westgate.
	* She is the latest apprentice of the legendary adept Einrich. 
	* They were investigating the ruins of the Temple of Ramenos when they discovered a mysterious orb that transported them that led them to the Illefarn Portals... *and 70 years into the future*.
	* They were ambushed by a team of bullywugs, yuan-ti and batrachi.
	* She awoke six days later in this prison. 
* **Grunddle** masterminded a spectacular multi-spell escape plan and freed himself. **Vold** used his breath-weapon to crispify one of the goblins and weaken his cell bars. 
* **Tal** made acquaintances with the Tavernlords using a native languages to mask the conversation from the guards and then summoned her double-bladed scimitar.
* The Tavernlords made quick work of the guards, but found themselves trapped in the jail instead of their cells.
* Unable to open the door on the ceiling, their search for hidden passages, mechanisms and they discovered a passage way that led them deeper into the villain's lair.
## Mysterious Chambers
* This area of the subterranean lair was different: cleaner and well lit by lanterns. **Vold** discovered a another stairway, but the others found a few things even more interesting.
* First they found another cell that held Soluun, a drow who claimed that he was highly placed in the Bregan D'earth who had been captured a few days ago.
* Beyond Soluun and his warnings of *wolf-creatures* they found another series of chambers. In these chambers were casket-sized crystalline structures with faceted-gemlike surfaces with a small jar-like container on the face of each. Barely translucent, almost opaque, inside each were bodies in various forms of development. Some of them very recognizable.

* **Vold** destroyed the one that looked like AJ Frost and **Tal** destroyed the one that resembled Einrich. But in the end, they decided that there were too many to smash and took Soluun's warning and escaped through a second exit that they found on the east side of the chamber.
* They found themselves about a mile away east of the Admiral's Foot.
* **Grunddle** marked Soluun with a message for the Waterdeep authorities and the rest of the Tavernlords and they sent him on his way.
* The Tavernlords and **Tal** began to prep to rescue **Erethil**, **Taklak** (and **Stupid**) and **Xzet**. And, of course their gear.
