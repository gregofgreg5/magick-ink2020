## The Conclusion: The Temple of Ramenos
## The Tower of Darkness
 * Having stood timelessly through eons of legends as mere ruins, no one has ever been able to recount ***when*** the Tower of Darkness was an actual complete structure, who built, or what it was used for.
 * There are hundreds of stories from every walk of creature on Sword Coast about this Tower and it's surrounding glade. All of them with a hinge of sinister darkness, evil. Many of them describe the Tower as a place of refuge for dark creatures or some kind of *means of safe passage*.
 * The ruins of the Tower are in the middle of small glade with slow descending slope from the southwest and is defined at the northern edge by the base of the mountain ***Karakrak***.

)
 * The area is filled with a strange, greenish-blue mist, thick and heavy with strange, tendril like movement in the air. The stench of battle, blood and a smell of ochre like burnt copper smothered them as they moved through the familiar portal.
 * The glade had become a battlefield, with corpses of yuan-ti, bullywugs, batrachi and completely strange and indescribable monsters. Most of them, bat-winged, barrel-shaped trunks with bloodied, spined tendrils at their base; but the largest was the size of a building... another horror, this one was *fortunately, also dead.
 * As they walked through the area they found that strange creatures were bubbling up in their footsteps: bulbous, frog-like creatures, which ranged from a few inches  to a just over two feet tall. The *creatures* swarmed them, exploding into a poisonous gas as soon as they were dealt any wound.
 * A few of the team fell paralyzed to the poison, but were revived by Erethil and other healers in the party. Fortunately, had the the poison taken hold the paralysis would have turned to petrifaction with the victim becoming a hardened into a cocoon-like state. The creature that would emerge would either become a bullywug or, more those whose body had more magical influence, would have become batrachi.
 * Realizing that they couldn't defeat the swarm, they retreated to the cave beneath the giant skeleton.

 * Inside the cavern they two very familiar structures: the stone arch and pool. The arch looked the same, but the pool was different, the ring around the pool was more complete and ornamental. Emerging from the portal was a chaos elemental. The pool appeared to be inside a chaos elemental, but it's colors were more muted, subdued and it moved much less frenetically, slower. Finally they found Einrich's body, lying beside a symbol burned into the ground with nine glowing crystals.

* After the team carefully inspected the diagram, **Vold** and **Xzet** (the mimic) *pocketed* the gems.
* The team discovered the atmosphere around the pool, with the more *muted* chaos elemental felt even *more wrong* somehow. Having seen what the pools were capable of, first hand with Remeele, they decided to try the portal instead.
* Crossing through the gateway, they experienced the familiar dry ***whoosh*** and the sensation that felt more like liquid than air rushing past them, seemingly pushing and pulling them forward at the same time.


## Return to the Temple of Ramenos

* They emerged into a chamber that was both the foyer of an ancient temple and cavern. 
* Two inches of the same clear liquid, with a murky cloud covered most of the floor. They could see *things* moving - more darting than swimming beneath the murk.
* Lit from an eerie blue-light iminating from the liquid, the chamber stretched up further than any eyes could see, in to the pitch black. Above them, they could *sense* more than hear even more things *larger* things passing above them.
* More of the exploding bubble-frogs emerged in the liquid around them.
* There were two doorways. One looked like it was filled with the same liquid. The other, was more like a mirror.
* The things in the water were *fear eyes*, that looked like eyeballs with eyestalk tendrils trailing behind them. Any time anyone tried to move across or over the liquid, a handful of them would fly towards them; causing the victims to be paralyzed in fear. 
* Only by facing their fears could they shake the paralysis. Those who couldn't muster the courage were rescued by **Erethil**.
* **Harriet** flew up to investigate, but was deterred by a swarm of large bat-like things.
* Upon closer inspection, the mirrored doorway looked into another room, but when they tried to pass through, they stepped right back through to the same room.
* On side of the doorway, they discovered a small compartment that had the same symbol that they found next to Einrich's body. They inserted the orange gem to open the doorway.

## Awakening a god

* The battle began almost as soon as they crossed to the other side of the doorway.
* A handful of yuan-ti and batrachi defended the chamber, keeping them from the stairs.
* Above them they could see the gigantic form of frog-deity Ramenos. A faint glow of a chaos elemental sparkled around the grotesque mass.
*  **Vold's** [black tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/black-tentacles) and **Shiluo's** [*warding wind*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/warding-wind) were as effective against their enemies as they were hindering to their allies.
* **Ramenos** leapt down to the battle, crushing anyone beneath it's girth. It's mighty bellows shook the chamber and everyone inside.
* After a fierce battle, **Ramenos** was felled, only to see the strange glow of the chaos elemental around it waver and then the mighty toad re-emerged, re-vitalized!
* The team realized that the battle may not be won there, in combat, split off - *which is, of course always a great idea*. However, in this case it was a wise choice. **Remeele, Shiluo, Vold, Xzet, and Erethil and Grunddle** moved further into the temple while the rest held off Ramenos.
