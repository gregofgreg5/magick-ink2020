# The Conclusion: The Temple of Ramenos
## The Tower of Darkness
 * Having stood timelessly through eons of legends as mere ruins, no one has ever been able to recount ***when*** the Tower of Darkness was an actual complete structure, who built, or what it was used for.
 * There are hundreds of stories from every walk of creature on Sword Coast about this Tower and it's surrounding glade. All of them with a hinge of sinister darkness, evil. Many of them describe the Tower as a place of refuge for dark creatures or some kind of *means of safe passage*.
 * The ruins of the Tower are in the middle of small glade with slow descending slope from the southwest and is defined at the northern edge by the base of the mountain ***Karakrak***.

 * The area is filled with a strange, greenish-blue mist, thick and heavy with strange, tendril like movement in the air. The stench of battle, blood and a smell of ochre like burnt copper smothered them as they moved through the familiar portal.
 * The glade had become a battlefield, with corpses of yuan-ti, bullywugs, batrachi and completely strange and indescribable monsters. Most of them, bat-winged, barrel-shaped trunks with bloodied, spined tendrils at their base; but the largest was the size of a building... another horror.
