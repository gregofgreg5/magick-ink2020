# 21-02-03 Campaign Notes

## Dragons, dragons everywhere!

### We all live on a manta-submarine...
A few hours after sabotaging *Eyecatcher*, the Tarvernlords found themselves sitting a few meters beneath the surface of the ocean in the *Scarlet Marpenoth* with the newest employees renegotiating the terms of their service. Barakka, understanding that they might be in a bind if the gnomes found out that they were driving them to half a million gold pieces, for a measley 100 gp per day, sought to renegotiate. A wise move considering the only way back was likely to be this submarine. Learning the true objective, the gnomes huddled. **Screech**, the spokeman for the gnome's union started the negotiations at 100,000 gp. *Luzeiros* did not [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave) them. After a brief discussion, the sum of 15% (75,000 gp if the Tavernlords found the whole 500,000). In jest (?), Screech confided to Jarik that *they would have settled for 10k.* And they were off.

Jarik produced the *Stone of Golorr* and handed it to Screech. As before, the room filled with a pale green light, with dark green hues flying all around them. The stone rose into the air and the show repeated.

Screech and his *brothers* stared at it. When it finished they stood bewildered. They conferred breifly and then Screech asked if they could hold the stone while they drove, motioning them to follow him to the bridge.

On the bridge, two gnomes helmed the ship while Screech spun the rock on a small map table in the center of the room in front of them. Suddenly an eerie, glowing orb, the color of the stone appeared in the ocean out in front of the Marpenoth. Excitedly Screech pointed at the visage and the engine purred to life, following the light. And the hunt was on.

The trip is wildly uneventful. The journey takes ten days. Ten long days of alternating between boredom, nausea and claustrophobia. The gnomes are very good at avoiding potentially dangerous sea-life. Sometimes powering down quickly and waiting in the current until something large passed: an octopus, a sea-dragon, that sort of thing. The gnomes take turns helming the ship and Marpenoth runs almost non-stop all day.

At one point during the journey, Luzeiros took some time to investigate the Stone of Golorr. It appeared like it would have a texture, it looked almost flesh-like, scaled, with three-eyes cared into the stone. The stone itself was otherwise unremarkable. Despite appearing to have different colors and textures, the stone appeared to be made of one contiguous rock, of some kind. While the firbolg was looking at it, Jarik realized that the stone had **changed shape**! It was about the same mass, but was more *squat*, had less length and more width. Shortly after it was returned to Jarik, while no one was watching it, it's shape returned to *normal*.

### Drow prisoners 
The only ones for whom the trip was worse was the four drow prisoners. Trapped in a small cabin, the Tavernlords kept them fed (bread) and watered. Enough nourishment to keep Barakka happy, but not enough that they'd likely be a problem down the road.

A guard was posted, usually Jarik (and by extension Ursula), but Luzeiros and Barakka also took their turn. It was very plain that the guard was as much to keep the drow in the room (which wasn't really an issue) as it was to keep Borl away from them.

## Jarlaxle Baenre 
Barakka's tour and subquent ten-day education on the inner workings of the Scaret Marpenoth was useful. It didn't keep him for continually asking "Can't this thing go faster?" every couple days, the *Paladin equivalent* to *Are we there yet?*. In truth, Barakka did learn alot about the submarine and how it works. He learned enough to recognize an amazing amount of craftmanshipo in the Lantanese built ship. He quietly added Lantan to his list of places he'd like to visit one day. *Maybe sooner rather than later*, now that Peyton Song of Tyr has moved to Waterdeep.

Depite Barakka's new appreciation for the submersible and it's creators. The most interesting bit of information on the voyage came from Screech. In his (*seemingly constant*) praise of his new employers, he related to thiem that the gnomes did not really like working for the previous owner of the Marpenoth. To no surprise, the flamboyant Zardoz Zord, who escaped their fury when they boarded *Eyecatcher* was the captain. To everyone's surpise, Zord was actually an alias for the legendary **Jarlaxle Baenre**. Baenre, also a drow, was the founder and leader of the Bregan D'aerthe. On the surface the Bregan D'aerthe are a *mercinary guild* and operate in cities (like Waterdeep) with at least some level of legitimacy. In fact, the Bregan D'aerthe are ruthless drow criminals, *slightly better* than the Zhentarim and Xanthar Guild.

First the Tavernlords irked the Xanthar, killing one of it's favorite lieutenants and then wound up on Manshoon's list, the ancient (long thought dead) wizard who founded the Zhentarim over two hundred years ago. And now this. *Jarlaxle Baenre* and the entire Bregan D'aerthe. On the bright side, no sign of Asmodeus (*yet*).

## Journey's end
The end of the journey neared as the Scarlet Marpenoth followed the glowing orb into a chasm and then into a cave in the cliff-face. The submarine speed slowed to a drift as it continued to wind down into the cavern. Over an hour goes by, with the Marpenoth continuing to descend before it leveled off into a wider body of water, in still in unlit cavern. Abruptly the orb flies straight up. The sub comes to a frantic halt and the gnomes feverishly check their instruments. Screech peers up through the lookout canopy at the top of the bridge, shouting out numbers in gnomish.

The cavern continued ahead of the Marpenoth, but the orb ascended through vertical a channel. After a brief moment of checking what they can see against their ship's charts, all four of the gnomes began to make adjustments on their instruments and controls. Slowly the sub began to angle *upward*, towards the narrow chimney. The Tavernlords found hand-holds or something to brace themselves as the nose of the submarine rises towards, what they assume is the surface.

Pitched in a 90-degree angle from their previous direction, it is a very nerve wracking thirty minutes. The passage widened and terrifyingly narrowed around the submarine. Finally they see the orb, *floating* above them. **Floating** above the water. Floating above the water... The gnomes burst into frenetic action again, shouting numbers in gnomish and curses at each other as the sub seemed to spin and twirl. Finally, the Tavernlords feel the sub level out. A quick check of the instruments and Screech told them that it appeared that they entered a large subterranean pool, about 100 feet deep. Looking out the view window they can see that the gnomes were able to park the sub in the only way that it fit in the pool.

The cavern was lit from the very base of the cave walls and through various cracks throughout the cavern. The light was bright enough to provide normal vision, green, but normal. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/OpEwOoG.jpg)

The Marpenoth was on the surface of a large pool at the south-east corner of a very large subterranean cavern. In the center of the cavern is a elevated platform, a mesa about 55 wide and 35 feet across, an easy 35 feet above the ground. Above them, the walls of the cavern sloped up as if towards a dome, but the illumination didn't climb all the way to the top. On the opposite side of the chamber, to the north is another, smaller pool. On either side of that pool, there were landings. On the south-west side of the cavern, there was a huge carving of a dragon, in-laid in gold, that stretched for 50 feet around the cavern and stood 15 feet high. 

After a quick discussion, the drow prisoners were bound and dragged out of the sub and placed in front of the carved dragon. Screech and one of the gnome engineers were asked to accompany the Tavernlords into the cavern, *for their expertise* in... uhm, *strange glowing caverns*. No fool, Screech told the Tavernlords, that while it may seem that their loyalties wre for sale, that they had no allegiance to Baenre and frankly the drow, the behavior,* kind of creeped* the gnomes out. He explained that he still understood their concern and agreed to go with them and suggested that the rest of his team take the Marpenoth down a few feet, so that if the drow do get any ideas, it would be harder for them to the ship. They agreed.

The main cavern appeared to be empty, The air was moist and smelled fresh, almost *too fresh*. There was a slight breeze that came from above. The ground was solid and felt soft beneath their boots. The team split up, their gnome companions in tow.

Ursula, the huge polar bear and Luzieros, *who some consider big for a firbolg*, went to check out the landing on the left, to the north-west of the second pool. At first, both found the walls more slick and slimy than they had anticipated and came crashing to the damp ground. *At first you don't succeed*, the two made the 15 foot climb to the landing more uneventfully on the second try. 

Along the walls of the cavern were dust-covered frescoes of ceramic, stone and metal depicting six heroes clad in ornate armor with swords, axes, shields and a variety of weapons. In the center of them there was an iron fresco of a dwarf smith at work in their forge and an inscription carved into the walls in dwarvish: *"Let hearts be lifted and battles won."* The landing followed along the cavern to a small alcove with about a foot drop and three inches of *clear* liquid covering the floor. Otherwise they found this side of the landing was empty and unremarkable. Ursula slid down the side of the wall and bounded over to check on Jarik. Luzeiros was less graceful, but was too firbolg to rub the small wound on his posterior.

On the other side, the two giants find more of the same. This landing is only ten feet above the floor of the cavern. Similar to the landing on the other side the walls of this part of the cave were adorned with frescoes of ceramic, stone and metal heroes (again mostly human). In the furthest end of the chamber is an iron anvil. The anvil is 3 feet tall and 4 feet long, 18 inches wide. Above the anvil was a small indention in the wall, *about palm-size*. Both of them were certain what would fit into that space. Ursula almost went to get the Stone of Golorr from Jarik, but they decided to check out the glowing pool between the two landings instead.

While Borl and Barakka inspected the carving of the dragon (which was just a stone carving with gold plating), Luzeiros and Ursula checked out the *moon pool*. Set between the two moon pools the pool went down an *indiscriminate* depth, but was lit by the glow of what appeared to be a huge cache of gold. *The dragons! At last!* They thought.

Luzeiros climbed down the rickety ladder and tried to make out the depth, but all he could tell, was that it was *really, really deep*. But he didn't touch it, just hung there above it. *Not that we're making any judgment here.*

Meanwhile, Jarik and the gnomes had come back over to the pool. Looking down, with gold dragons in their eyes, Jarik devised a plan to retrieve them, without testing the waters. *Again, no judgment...*. 

Hearing the giants description of the two landings, Barakka, climbed up to the landing on the left (north-west), where he investigated the frescos and carvings on that side more closely. Looking at the iron dwarf carving, he noticed that there was something more interesting about the hammer in the dwarf's hands. He noticed clearly that there was a separation between the hammer and the wall. He *jiggled it*. By then, Ursula had joined him and assisted him pulling the hammer out of the wall.

Jarik conjured an [Unseen Servant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/unseen-servant). They all watched the glowing pool, half-a-million gold pieces illuminating the pit, by sheer force of their immense value, *no one brave enough to even touch the water*, staring as a thing that they couldn't see, without a physical form moved through the *water*. It got a little further than half way down before reaching it's limitations and dispersing.

Ursula retrieved the stone from Jarik and then went with Barakka to make their way over to the anvil. Luzeiros climbed back up from the ladder and joined them. Ursula cleared away the cobwebs to reveal the inscription (written in dwarvish): *"Let the hammer fall and the anvil rung"*

Deciding it was a *good omen*, she moved to put the stone in the wall. Before she could lodge the stone into the indention, the stone *leaped* to the wall and fit into the space. The wall appeared to grab a hold of it.

Carefully Barakka hammered the anvil.

**Suddenly a bright green light filled the entire chamber, along every artery and landing**

Everyone felt refreshed and relaxed, even. Luzeiros noticed that even the scrapes on his buttocks had healed.

Meanwhile, next to Borl **an ancient dwarf, in beautiful, ornate robes, with a powerful looking staff* appeared. Also, the landing on the left, north-west, was suddenly filled with gold. At last, for real, Neverember's dragons were indeed found.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs1IaWM.jpg) Barok Clanghammer

As the dwarf looked purposefully around the cavern, he asked "Who sent you?"

Borl quickly replied "No one. We.." When it didn't appear that the answers that Borl was giving him were satisfying the dwarf, Jarik began talking to him. Jarik, who is quickly finding himself the Tavernlords most *effective communicator*, even initially had trouble getting on the same page with the dwarf.

"Neverember" Luzieros muttered and whether anyone had heard him, the name floated around the room, like a spell spoken among the group. Barakka mentioned that they were *not exactly friends with Neverember*, which didn't seem to please Clanghammer.

"You don't trust the Open Lord, eh?" the dwarf asked as he paced around to the other side of the mesa.

Realizing that they wer talking about two different people, Barakka exclaimed, "No, Renear! Not Dagul!" And he went on to explain that they thought that Dagul was dead. Or at least presumed dead.

Luzeiros, trying to help out, with where they'd come from and why they were looking for the dragons, mentioned the crazy old *undead wizard* and suddenly something piqued in the old dwarf. He was on the other side of the mesa, working his way back around, with a few of the Tavernlords trying to keep up. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/QyO0MQi.jpg) Clanghammer's staff

The old dwarf, dragging his staff or alternately using it as a walking stick, was a fast bugger. After getting what little else they knew about Dagul, he moved on to questioning them about the wizard.

Luzeiros and Jarik began telling him about the wizard, *Manshoon* and how he is extorting them to find the gold for them.

The dwarf stopped in his tracks at the name and seemed to grow agitated, "Wizard, tell me more about the wizard!" He walked around the mesa again, faster, his trailing Tavernlords having a harder time keeping up. This time, however by the time he reached the other side he had reverted to his true form and stood before them in all of his golden glory.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fETIjOG.png) Aurinax

He stood over 50 feet from his head to the ground and at least 70 feet long to his tail.  He stood menacing with his huge wings tucked against his body. Terrifying, impressive, towering... his solid black eyes gleamed in anger.

"Manshoon!" He wailed, stretching the name out to at least four syllables as he advanced on the Tavernlords in front of him, Barakka, Borl and Luzeiros. "Tell me more about my ancient enemy!" He demanded more than asked.

Quickly the Tavernlords told them everything that the knew. They watched as the dragon digested the information and seemed to grow more angry. "Gold isn't a bad one..." Urusla whsipered to the air. "Gold isn't a bad one..."

"You're no friends of Manshoon..." he said, his head swinging over the mesa. "And you've told me where you found him." Suddenly his head spun, with lightning speed over the mesa and stared at the terrified, bound drow. "And what of these? I know the drow and they are like Manshoon. What of these?"

"They're not with us." Ursula cried quickly, pointing at the ropes binding them.

"They can't be trusted." He turned to the Tavernlords, "Can you be trusted?"

"Yes!" They all shouted.

"How many times do I have to kill this accursed wizard?!?" He swung his head around again. He had taken Neverember's charge, for the gems, he knew. He felt bad about it at the time, but the gems. There were so many, so tasty. And he could use the rest. His crusade had gone on for so long. So he took Neverember's charge, never asking where the gold had come from, promising to guard it. In his heart he wondered, he maybe even knew, that Neverember was wrong. But he had taken the gems, eaten many, he could not go back on his word. But that *freaking wizard Manshoon*, oh how he hated that Manshoon. "How many times do I have to kill you before you stay dead? You miserable bastard?"

The Tavernlords were silent and did their best to keep Borl silent. "Do you swear on your word, your bond that you will return the gold to Waterdeep? If it were stolen as you say, it belongs there."

"Yes!" They all shouted again.

He looked at the drow and the pool, where the submarine lay beneath the surface, "How do I know I can trust you?"

Almost in unison, four of the Tavernlords produced their Writs from the Open Lord of Waterdeep, proclaiming their deputized status. All of them except for Borl, who looked both irritated and embarassed not to have a warrant of his own. 

Deeming those were acceptable, he told them to free the drow and stand away. Without question Luzieros and Jarik freed them. As soon as they were free and began to move about, their mouths ungagged, but before they could speak, the dragon let loose it's terrible fiery breath. A blistering heat filled the cavern and in an instant the drow were gone!

"Aurinax, my name is Aurinax." He turned back to the Tavernlords, who were doing their best not to looks shocked or terrified. Screech and his gnomes ducked behind Ursula. "We have just sworn a blood oath. Do you agree?"

Everyone nodded. Even Borl.

"The portal that you discovered by the anvil can take you home. Knock on the frame and say the destination and it will take you there, but only there. Trollskull Manor, you say. I know this place. It was great once, but had fallen. If you have restored it, so be it, let the door open there. Only you will be able to see the door on the other side. I leave this horde to you, to return to Waterdeep as you promised, but do not touch my gems! Are we agreed?"

Everyone nodded, even Borl.

In a blink the gargantuan dragon was gone and the humble, noble looking dwarf stood in his place, holding his mighty staff. They watched as he walked to the landing on the north-east and then held up the staff and levitated to the shelf. His staff glowing, he walked to the portal, tapped the end of it to the top of the doorway and left.

## Some loose ends
# Screech & the gnomes

Again, deciding what to do with these guys came down to *how much can we trust them*? After all they worked for the drow for who knows how long.

Grateful that they weren't sent the way of the drow, but Screech still seemed a little disheartened that their integrity was still in question. Granted, 500,000 gold pieces is a lot of trust for strangers that you didn't know 10 days ago.

**The Door**
After testing the door, they learned that door indeed lead to the cellar in Trollskull Manor. All five of the Tavernlords that were on site could open the door and go through. Once the door was open, anyone (Emmett) could also go through and come back. More relevant to this part of the story, Screech and his lieutenant (***Beek***) who had been the one in the chamber with Aurinax, could also open the portal. None of the other gnomes could open the portal on either side. The door appeared to stay open in the cavern, but could be closed, by knocking on it, from Trollskull manor. Once closed, there was absolutely no evidence that it ever existed. On the cavern side, because the doorway remained, the Stone of Golorr remained... *concealed*.

**Back to the gnomes.**
The idea of taking them all back to Trollskull Manor was floated. Clearly the Tavernlords weren't ready to trust anyone with this treasure. Even their new *friends*, that they purchased fair and square *sort of*. The gnomes did not like that idea. While they were happy to live off of their newly acquired wealth, they had absolutely **no interest** in going back to Waterdeep. They wanted to be as far away from Jarlaxle Baenre and his Bregan D’aerthe for as long as possible. While it still hadn't quite set in with the Tavernlord the (new) hornet's nest that they had just kicked over, the gnomes were well aware of the nefarious guild and what they would do to some treacherous gnomes.

As a compromise, Screech went back to the Marpenoth, which he now recognized as belonging to the Tavernlords, and brought back a glowing orb. Barakka confirmed, from his previous tours that this was the magical power source of the submarine. From his questioning earlier he could also confirm that there were no others like it on board. And that well before this was ever a concern, the gnomes had expressed that this was what made the submarine run. Screech offered it to Jarik, telling him that the gnomes would, for the most part stay here and guard the Tavernlords treasure, venturing into the Manor and Waterdeep to collect supplies. Eventually, he was sure that some would want to leave for other opportunities, and that some - like himself, would probably prefer to stay with the Marpenoth. And after a reasonable amount of time, to figure out who was whom, he would be happy to negotiate a reasonable fee to stay on board and train some of them to drive the boat.

Again, Screech offered a reasonable and unassailable offer. Jarik thought that Screech might be good to have around sometime. The Tavernlords accepted.

## Back at the manor
When Barakka stepped through the portal into the cellar, the first of the Tavernlords to make the trip, it had been over 11 day since they'd last been in the Manor.

In quieter, more civil times perhaps, if the proprietors of the manor or tavern were gone for a week or ten days and their staff were left appraised, or sometimes even not, that would be unremarkable. These are not those times, nor are these those owners.

### The Zhents
Every morning the Zhentarim agents still showed up. They began to become more unruly on the third morning. That morning, Jake happened to be at the tavern having breakfast with his parents and the Softsongs. The next morning Renear and two, very nondescript, *Harpers* showed up to *have breakfast* and conduct their morning business, quietly at one of the corner tables. From that time on, a rotating selection of Harpers could be found hanging out at the tavern, usually at that table. 

It's the Harpers business to react to evil doing, to correct it. Prevention typically isn't their forte. But for Neverember, this was personal. Despite any misgivings, he has never taken his rescue lightly.

The Zhentarim still came by every morning, waiting for the Tavernlords return, but they did so much, much more civilly . 

### Softsong & Fazzanachs
In the absence of the Tavernlords, the Softsongs stood up and picked up more work around the tavern. Slowly, they seemed to be adjusting to their new lives. Many of the patrons of the tavern come looking forward to the camaraderie and friendship of the Softsongs. In the last week or so they really seem to be clearing from the understandably, ever-present fog that they'd been under.

Xanyas Fazzanch was another matter entirely. While, for the most part he still lived at the manor and showed up for most of his shifts, he had become even more dark and sullen. He even disappeared for two days entirely, missing one of his shifts. Hannah and Emmett had become very worried about the young halfling.

## The end is near
* So here we are. The Tavernlords, or half of them at least, have found **Neverember's coveted Dragon Horde**. 

* They've returned with two and half nimblewrights in tow. 

* **Vallera** at the House of Inspired Hands *is not their biggest fan.* 

* There is an *ancient gold dragon* on the hunt for **Manshoon**, which one would hope might keep him busy for awhile, if not solve that problem.

* It's reasonable to expect some fallout from the sinking of *Eyecatcher*.

* Certainly part of that will be coming from the **Bregan D’aerthe**. *Whoever they are*
 
* And, the **Xanthar Guild** still wants a piece of the Tavernlords.
 
* And **no one knows** that you have the dragons. And 

***What's next...???***
