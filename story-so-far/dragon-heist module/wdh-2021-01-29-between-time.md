## *Meanwhile in Waterdeep...*

![](https://i.imgur.com/9oGUasR.jpg)

From the pier **Thaggus, the Harbor Master** and **Chella**, his tortle associate stare into the harbor where a ship sunk just before dawn. They look at the water, as if they could will the ship back to the surface, but both men know that *this time* that won't be happening.

"*Zord*" Chella said with a sublte, sarcastic tone, "is not happy. He has already involved his *friends* at the *Bregan D'aerthe*. There are going to be drow creeping and crawling all over this place tonight."

Thaggus shuffled his shoulders and made a quiet irritable sound, "Well,... we can't have that. Have Gurth and Haark get some of their associates together to discourage any intrusion into anyone else's business."

"The drow aren't going to be easy to discourage." Chella stares out on to the horizon.

"Whatever Haark needs."

"And you're... I mean, I know you're sure. We can't bring *Eyecatcher* back up? You know like..."

The Harbor Master looked up at the sky, a storm brewing over the bay. He just shook his head *no*, his long beak like a wand in front of him. Few know of the great power that the Harbor Master weilds, his strange mastery over the sea and storm. Fewer still comprehend exactly how powerful he is. In the past he has brought up ships so that they could be repaired, when the damage was significant but not quite this catastrophic. From what he could tell, the ocean punched a huge hole through the bottom of the ship, where it had already been damaged. It was impossible to tell, but from what he guessed, there was already a hole in the deck of the ship that had also weakened the structure of the vessel. Between the two, the ship seemingly cracked in half and then folded in on itself.

*Eyecatcher* was a beautiful vessel, expensive, solid - one of the finest ships that frequented the harbor. Now it's crushed kindling at the bottom of the harbor. Chella estimated that aside from the value of the ship, the manifest and loss of the crew's possessions would be close to 15,000 gp. At least half of that was from the fully loaded cargo that they had just taken on, most of the rest was in Zord's cabin.

"No sign of the Scarlet Marpenoth?" Chella asked.

Thaggus looked across at his friend, "It made for open sea, headed south west. At speed."

Chella chuckled, "Gnomes must be complicit."

Thaggus looked at him with humor in his cold eyes, "Indeed."

"Do you think *Zord* knows his sub is gone?" Chella asked.

An aarakocra, it is sometimes hard to read the Harbor Master's features. But there's no way Chella could have missed the wicked grin beaming across his beak.

## The Zhentarim

After the second day in which his messenger reported that the Tavernlords were not at Trollskull Manor, **Manshoon** became suspicious. He knew, in his cold, dark heart that these *thugs* could not be trusted. They were on to something, that he was sure of. Maybe they weren't smart, but they were lucky, he thought.

It was a good thing that he had someone following them. He knew that they went to *Eyecatcher* and sunk it. While his spies had not returned a favorable report,, he was also certain that they had survived the excitement... as sure as he was that they had caused the destruction.

*But where, where did they go?!?*

Of course, he still had his *ace up his sleeve*, his *loaded dice*, there was no way that they could know that they'd been *marked*. All he had to do was activate the spell and wherever they were would be revealed. But if he did it too soon, they'd escape. The spell was powerful, *of course it was, he wrote it!*, but even still, it has it's limits and time was one of them.

*Blasted time, always blasted time. When I regain my full power, do away with time, that's what I'll do* he thought to himself, his long fingers tapping together, a evil grin cutting across his ancient features.

## The Scarlet Marpenoth!

The Scaret Marpenoth was designed and built in the island-nation of Lantan in 1489, it came into the possession of *Zardox Zord* and the *Sea Maidens Faire* in 1491 (just over a year ago, if you're keeping track).


* Dimensions: 60' x 20' 
* Chambers are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them.
* All furnishings and features are bolted down. Doors are made of steel.
* Air magically circulates through a complex ventilation system and small metal grills set into the floors.
* Engine was a quasi-magical device that controlled the ship's depth, as well as the steering fins and rudder, and powered its propulsion system. It could be piloted from the ship's control room.
* Maximum speed: 2 miles per hour (48 miles per day)
* The ship had a defense system that allowed its outer hull to become electrified for a short period of time.
* Capacity: 10 crew (max., Min 2), 10 passengers
* Two ton cargo capacity

*The Marpenoth* is a far cry from the luxury of the *Eyecatcher*, the submarine is more spartan and utilitarian, but is not without it's comforts. Like the rest *mother vessel*, the Marpenoth is fully loaded with food and cargo.

Not the fine cuisine, the drow were used too on the sailing ship either, the food is still more than a few rungs above rations.

The wine, a drow blend, a dark zinnfindel that that is so heavy that you could almost chew it. Dark berries, chocolate and gunpowder make for a surprisingly wonderful flavor. Not the mead or ale from the tavern, but in a pinch, it's pretty good. Or *good enough*.

# The voyage

After Ursula came back to the ship, the tavernlords got settled with the gnomes. The gnomes, who truly have no allegience to the drow who hired them to maintain and pilot the Marpenoth, were happy to take a small retainer on the promised reward. 

A short discussion insued, in which it was discussed whether or not they could trust the gnomes. Already about four miles from Waterdeep, it was decided *what could possibly go wrong?... more wrong?*

Jarik produced the *Stone of Golorr* and handed it to **Screech**, the spokeman for the gnome's union. As before, the room filled with a pale green light, with dark green hues flying all around them. The stone rose into the air and the show repeated.

Screech and his *brothers* stared at it. When it finished they stood bewildered. They conferred breifly and then Screech asked if they could hold the stone while they drove, motioning them to follow him to the bridge.

On the bridge, two gnomes helmed the ship while Screech spun the rock on a small map table in the center of the room behind them. Suddenly an eerie, glowing orb, the color of the stone appeared in front of the Marpenoth. Excitedly Screech pointed at the visage and the engine purred to life, following the light.

Sure, it took them in a complete 180, but they were on their way. It was only a matter of time before they'd reach their destination and.. ***half a million dragons***. 

*boy, I hope those really are pieces of gold and not actual*...
