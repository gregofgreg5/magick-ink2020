# The Story So Far…

The four of you are: **Goredon Ramsey** (minotaur/fighter), **Gunmetal Grey** (gnome/artificier), **Manny** (half-elf/rogue), and **Talib Beni-Asmodai** (tiefling/cleric), all members of **Force Grey**. Some of you have worked together (briefly) before, but this is your first time together. Gunmetal has a Steel Defender, a mechanical dog of sorts. 
At about 2 AM you were summoned to **Cavalier Villa**, where you met with Force Grey Captain Guryon.

Cavalier Villa is a renown manor and place of notoriety in Waterdeep. It was built over a hundred years ago by *Lhorar Gildeggh, a Lord Magister*. It was built to be a gift for his most loyal Myrmidon, *Henric the Seventh*, the house served as the chief residence to some of the most esteemed warriors of various Lords for many decades. Cavalier Villa has passed through several hands since then. Most of them young noble houses or ***noble-lites***: a not so flattering nickname given to houses that come from new money or have moved to Waterdeep in *recent times*. Cavalier Villa’s history has made it a minor treasure, symbol of prestige for these noble-lites.


**Garmain DeLaurent** purchased Cavalier Villa less than a decade ago. DeLaurent’s family are considered noble-lites. Their stock has pretty much peaked, while they are still part of the social-climbing scene in Waterdeep, their star has definitely faded. In truth, their finances have not gone well and they have been struggling to keep up appearances. This information comes from a Force Grey operative, investigating rumors that DeLaurent is involved in criminal activity. The operation has, for the most part, been unsuccessful. However there is an operative who is still investigating a possible connection between House DeLaurent and the Zhentarim.

Earlier this evening ***something*** happened at Cavalier Villa. Witnesses report that there were carriages and traffic coming and going to Cavalier Villa all day and that there was some kind of party this evening. Around midnight there was a horrific sound. Some described it like children being tortured, screaming, and some said animals being slaughtered, while others reported hearing thunder or explosions. A heavy, acrid smoke-like fog has engulfed the property. Lightning can be seen darting through the sky around the top of the building. 

From the stables, the Watch has surmised that there are at least seven other noble-lite houses are represented. The Watch has speculated that there are at least ten, maybe 12, of these noble-lites in there, including the DeLaurents. 

## Your mission: <br>Find out what is going on and stop it; rescue as many of the nobles as you can. Preferably all of them.

*A reminder: The Force Grey motto: Arrests, not caskets. Caskets, if you insist.*

Before you were summoned, two pairs of City Watch went in to investigate, about 45 minutes apart. They appeared to have been killed and turned into zombies of some kind. You dispatched with them fairly easily, en route to the Villa.

You entered the Villa into a foyer, which was deep with thick smoke. Almost immediately a man tried to run past you to the front door, but he was intercepted by Goredon. His exact words, after Goredon tackled him were: ***“It all went wrong! It wasn’t supposed to be like this! Not him,… Asmodeus. Close the portal…”*** and *just like that, you have rescued a noble-lite,* named **Eskander Bahrami**, He is known to Talib as a businessman with some minor criminal involvement.

You have also *rescued* **Ashani**, who has all the appearance of something that may have come through that portal. She told you that there was a summoning taking place here. She says that there are forces from Hell preparing to invade. She gave you the chest and told you it was part of the summoning ritual and that it was the key to breaking the first curse. Ashani implied the first curse was the smoke. Talib identified the runes as Infernal, but could not make sense of them. Casting identify, Gunmetal was able to decipher them as a locking sequence, to unlock the chest. When Gunmetal opened the chest, the smoke and the smoke mephits did indeed go away. She has agreed to Talib, to surrender to the custody of the City Watch, if you’ll get her out of here.

In the chest there were five statues. She waited patiently for you to examine them and when you wouldn’t she gave you these descriptions, as she handled each one, narrated the fondling.

1. **A clear crystal figurine of an ice devil (6”).** *One has already escaped your grasp, the best you can do now is contain the damage;*
2.  **A blood garnet statuette of a horned devil (8”),** *an insurmountable evil amasses an army at your gates, Waterdeep is beautiful and Hell is hungry;*
3. **A green jade figurine of an aligatorian shaman (4”)** *dangerous, unrelenting foes come in all shapes and sizes;*
4. **A golden figurine of a tiger (5” length-wise),** *very dangerous, indeed…*
5. **A white star sapphire figure of a small pawn-like figure with a mask (4”),** *and the key to ending this madness is, as always, masked.*

The door and windows in the room were locked. The door and windows have some kind of magic upon them that apparently rendered them unbreakable, at least to the methods and weapons that you have tried so far.

There is one other exit from the foyer, a door opposite of the main entry. Ashani has said that there is an inferno on the other side (which you have also seen on the map. *Oops*).

## Episode Two: Doggo has hit points

December 17, 2020

Manny and Gunmetal Grey investigated the bookcases and rest of the foyer throughly for other exits or hidden secrets, but find nothing. All that is left is to go through the door. A careful investigation revealed that it was free of traps, mimics and wasn't locked.

What was once a Great Hall has been caught up in flames. A torrential fire has engulfed the entire back portion of the room. However the team noticed that, on their  side of the room, only about 80 feet away, the temperature felt just above *normal*. More investigation was required. Gunmetal cast *detect magic* and the fire was indeed magic, as were Ahani and Eskander. To investigate further, he sent his robo-doggo to determine, who likely sees itself something like this:

The Steel Defender (aka *Robbo-doggo*) helped to determine that the closer that one got to the fire, the hotter it was, more than normmally so. In other words, it was okay on the other side of the room, but right next to the fire, it was **really hot**. The team also noticed a set of footprints that bisected the room. They seeming started somewhere near one of the doors on the left (the one above the fireplace, if anyone was keeping score) and lead directly to the door on the wall on the right side. The footprints were hard to miss, as they appeared to be steaming. Two options were considered, that they were so hot that they were still burning or that they were somehow wet, producing steam. Further investigation revealed that it was indeed steam and the footprints were frozen.

The door on the right was frozen shut, with a layer of ice, at least two inches thick holding it shut. Goredon did what he does and crashed into it, substantially cracking the ice. Talib used his righteous flame to assist and the two of them took down the ice barrier without much pause.
