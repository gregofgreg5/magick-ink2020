##The Really Bad Week
23 Nightal 1492 

It had already been a complicated week that started with a Xantharian firebombing and included half of the adventurers being sent on a mission to the Mere of Dead Men. The journey to the mere alone promised to be at at least twenty days. As if that weren't enough, the party gathered this morning to find that one of their own, the Mon-K'ee, had left. Leaving behind osprey, the Sinister knife and the Sinister ring for Borl. While discussing Mon-K'ee's departure, Borl discovered another package. This one wrapped and hidden underneath a bench, which he quickly passed off to Barakka to inspect.

Inside was a hand-sized wooden box with no marking or latches. When Barakka opened it, a brilliant light and smoke filled the room. The whispy forms of green, winged-snakes swirled round the room in the smoke, as two hulking figures materialized in the center of the room: ogres! During the pitched battle with the monsters, NAME, a giant ## foot tall, armored polar bear, Jarik's new *shield guardian* arrived and helped dispatched one of the ogres, almost single-handedly. However, before the second ogre could be dealt with a thurnderous explosion rocked Trollskull Alley. A bright light, from the tavern windows burst into the room as the whole street shook.
