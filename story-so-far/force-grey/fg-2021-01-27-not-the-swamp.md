## Episode Four: "Can't we go back to the portal?" -  January 27, 2021

Coming out of the cave, they found themselves at the edge of a swamp. They had been pretty sure, as they moved through the cavern that they were no longer in a building, but now they were certain, they were outside. The swamp stretched out in every direction, evey beyond the small knoll behind them. On this side, the cavern opens from a small hill rising out of the muck.

Around them were a lot of insects, birds, frogs and possibly gurgling of swamp gas and just general mysterious or suspicious splashes in the surrounding water, a way off in the distance. In your immediate vicinity you can see strange birds overhead and a lot of those bugs flying and crawling around. A lot of colorfull bugs.

The smell of decayed vegetation and fragrant plants, underlying the smell of compost, was made all the worse by moist, humid heat. Their feet began to sink into the muck as Grosh began to have second thoughts about this course of action. A discussion ensued and during the conversation Grosh picked the four-inch, green figurine of the *aligatorian shaman*. While it appeared to be jade, Grosh deduced that it wasn't, it was definitely heavier, more like stone or a rock. From a distance it appeared to be a *fine figure*, but up close he could tell that the carving was crude and rough.

Seeing that the minotaur didn't burst into flames, Gunmetal Grey picked up the golden tiger. Like the *shaman*, the tiger figurine wasn't made out of gold, it was much heavier and the color was darker, almost bronze. The stripes, while they appeared to be solid carvings, were actually some kind of script (*rakshaha*). Gunmetal cast [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) and revealed that the statue was not magic, but was magicked into existance when ***Dâ€™nani Yrrakis***, a rakshaha, crossed through *a portal*.

The discussion continued, on and on. Finally, Talib cast [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury) to help divine their best path. Paraphased as ***"Would going through the ice portal, would that lead to a resolution to the problem in the villa?*** Carefully he threw his five ceremonial knives and translated the direction of the blades and the turns of the bejeweled hilts.
> ***Weal and Woe***, a whisper floated through the small recess of Talib's mind: *Travel through the portal may prevent catastrophe, but will not save the villa*)

And it was decided, the agents of Force Grey turned back into the cavern and travelled back down the cavern. They travelled through the main chamber and back into the ice parlor and then into the library. Everything was just as they had left it. The portal that once lead to Styggia was still covered by a pile of bookcases, presumably still closed. The other, the ice portal, also remained open. On the other side, they could see the same sunny, rural area that they saw before.

## Through the portal

They tested the portal again, this time Grosh put a crossbow bolt through and brought it back, without breaching the portal himself. Gunmetal sent *doggo* through with instructions to come back, but it went through and stood there, with it's metal tail wagging. Boldly, Grosh stepped through the portal and stood next to doggo. He found himself in a rural countryside, with a small villiage down the road and a mountain range to the north (west). To his dismay, he turned and saw that there was no portal.

In, I'd like to say *desperation* or *an abundance of concern* but..., Gunmetal attached a rope to a bolt and fired it at Doggo, hoping to be able to give Grosh a line back to them. But the bolt flew into the countryside, hit the end of the rope and dropped to the ground. They couldn't see it near Grosh and Grosh couldn't see it.

Enraged, Eskander couldn't believe that they were actually considering going through the portal. Done with his charge's nonsense, Manny grabbed Eskander and tossed him through the portal. Unceremoniously he tumbled through and landed near Grosh's hooves.

While they team continued to discuss options, including leaving Grosh behind, and continuing to investigate the house (their mission), three kobolds approached Grosh and took up an aggressive posture. Acting in their nature, the lawmen, stepped through the portal and took Grosh's side. Two of the kobolds were dispatched handily, the third made a run for it, terrified by Grosh. He didn't get make it very far before Grosh charged over and grappled him into submission.

The strangest part of the interrogation of the kobold was that it had never even heard of Waterdeep, which was, to say the least distressing. He claimed to work for some dwarves up in ***Melairbode***. While no one else had heard it, the name rang a bell for Manny. After a moment of thought, *"Oh shit, I think we're 2000 years in the past."* (paraphased)

While coming to terms what could be their new predicament, a lone rider and a wagon came down the road toward them. The rider, Aaron, was sent to protect the three halflings who were on their way to meet some dwarves to trade wares. Typically, the hamlet and dwarves deal on *market days*, but this was a special arrangement. Judging them based on their appearance, *I mean a minotaur and a...whatever Talib is...*, he decided that they must be one of those travelling performing troops that he'd heard of back east. In what would have been parting, Manny warned him about the kobolds, but told him not to worry, that they'd been dispatched, the young Aaron seemed a bit concerned. Cautiously he asked whether the group would be interested in coming with them, and after he would make sure that they had a place to stay and some food for the evening.

The meeting with the dwarves was mostly unventful. The dwarves traded them some ore and small metals for some crafts. On the whole it didn't really seem like a fair deal, but the dwarves seemed happy with it. Gunmetal sought to find an audience with the dwarves king. These dwarves, who had never in their lives even seen the king, were amused by the travelling bards. A ruse made whole by Grosh producing his lyre! While they were in no position to offer an royal audience, they did suggest that the troop come back and perform their show for the dwarves and *see what happens*.

After a long day, that may have started a couple millennium from their meeting with the dwarves, Force Grey finaly made it to the hamlet of ***Tyr's Burden***. 

Tyr's Burden was a very small hamlet that started with 36 pioneers looking to start a new frontier. With dreams of creating a farming community, to do Tyr's work, they moved west. The majority of them came from the outskirts of a town called Morinden, which had become increasingly oppressive over the past few years. The lord of Morinden had steadily increased taxes on their produce and had even begun to tax the church. 

Led by **Maurice**, a young human cleric from *Tyr's Hold*, the local temple, six families and a handful of weary travelers head west. **Tyson**, Maurice's brother, who had been a local hero among the farmers was the natural choice to be the town's *mayor*. And **Horace Broadsword**, who was a guard in Morinden and somewhat of an *adventurer* in his youth, was the perfect choice to be the hamlet's *constable*.

Grateful for their service escorting Aaron and the halflings, Tyson offered them tents as a place to stay and invited them to join the residents in their communal evening meal. Talib, instead retired to his tent to commune with Helm. For the most part, a good time was had by all. At the end of the evening, Horace and Tyson pulled Manny and Grosh aside to tell them that they could tell that they were more than some *travelling minstrels*. From the team's garments and their weaponry they knew that they were less than civilian. They confided that the hamlet had been having trouble with orcs. Four times in the past few months a band of, no more than a dozen, orcs had rampaged through Tyr's Hold. They told the party that they were a small, new, but had hopes to become a legitimate town. They didn't have much, but would come up with a way to compensate Force Grey for their assistance. Tyson mentioned, that he had heard that they were looking for an audience with the king of the dwarves. He admitted that their contacts didn't go that high up, but offered to do what they could as partial payment. 

A deal was struck.

***It was agreed four days would pass between now and the next campaign.*** During this time, the party would settle in and learn what they could about their new surroundings. Specifically, Gunmetal intended to make an arrangement with the local dwarf family that had set up a smith business to lease space and their tools. So far, the agreed to allow time as a *retainer* for help with the orcs.

If there are any other **specific** things that anyone would like to do, or try to learn, let me know.
