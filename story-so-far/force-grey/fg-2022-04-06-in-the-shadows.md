## Chapter Two: The Fall of the Yawning Portal
### *The Story so far...* Cavalier Villa
Our team successfully foiled a plot to summon the forces of Asmodeus to the material plane by Germain DeLaurents and a coven of would-be cretins.

In the process, they chased a succubus through a portal into the *way back when* of Waterdeep. Dragging (actually throwing him through first) Eskander Behrami along with them.

They found succor in the recently established colony of *Tyr's Burden*, less than a days walk from the coast, *just outside* of where Waterdeep would one day stand. Helping out the their new friends, they hunted down a pack of orcs who had been terorrizing the village. 

The hunt led them to the *Legendary Tower of Darkness* where they discovered a long forgotten gateway to the Interplanar Port of *Thyrgarr Station*. 

The station quickly went into a lockdown and the team found themselves embroiled in the middle of a murder mystery and a coup that threatened existance across the interplanar thruway. They used their ingenuity to solve the mystery and foil the invasion and were able to book passage on a vessel that returned them... and Eskander! to their previous time and place.

In the chaos of dispatching Delaurents coven, Eskander, *taking the shape of Manny,* telling the Watch that the rest of the party was dead, he escaped into the night.

### Murder of Eleventoes
Later that same week, Delfh Eleventoes was murdered. Eleventoes was renown scoundrel, secretly an agent of Force Grey and a friend of Manny's. He had been investigating the *sale of a nefarious artifact*, the *Infernal Register*. The Register was said to be one of a set of tomes that identified hidden caches of supplies and powerful magic items that the hordes of Asmodeus had hidden across various planes.

To support his claim, *the seller*, none other than Eskander Behrami, had two infernal artifacts in his possession.

The team was brought in by the Blackstaff (commander of Force Grey) to find Eleventoes killer and figure out if Eskander really had the Infernal Register.

### The Hunt for Eskander
The trail for Eskander started with *Ne'aroff* a drow considered to be low level would-be criminal, with a loose affiliation with the Bregan D'earthe.

Ne'aroff worked for Old Xoblob, running errands in his shop. Xoblob had hired *Krentz*, a known Zhentarim lietuenant to find Ne'aroff. In their investigation, they stirred up the Bregan D'earthe, who also put a team on Ne'aroff's trail.

Gunmetal drank himself silly at the *Skewered Dragon* and the rest of the team followed the clues to one of Eskander's delapitated dock warehouses. They were able to rescue Ne'aroff from Krentz and his crew, arresting some and dispatching others to their makers. They were also attacked by a strange shadow-creature, that was also apparently after Ne'aroff. When the creature was killed, all that was left behind was an infernal dagger. 

Ne'aroff also declared that he had been secretly working with Eleventoes and provided a list of *people of interest* that he and been helping follow-up upon.

### Eleventoes's List

>**Snivel Hardbottom** - known assassin.
>
> **Orus the Axe** - mercinary, known to be affiliated with the Zhentarim.
> 
> **Hansel Orethax** - Solicitor who is known to have worked with the *Cassalanter family* and other wealthy nobles.
> 
> **Mannix (*The Answer Guy*)** Apparently working for Eskander.
> 
> **Roris WildShard** - *mysterious high elf*.
> 
> **Crystal Seenix** -  High level Scorceror in the Xanthar Guild. 
> 
> **Harmish Greatboar** -  fierce, ruthless, mercenary, thug. Some kind of *dwarf/dragonkind* hybrid.
> 
> **Neshir Bancroft II** -  *Loser!*

## On the Trail of Eskander (March 9. 2022) 
### Ne'aroff and the _Eye of Alussh_
With Ne'aroff and a handful of Zhents in custody, the Order of the Magists and Protectors identified the knife as a super rare vessel that had likely *housed* the shadow creature (*bladewrath*). The residual magic and wounds that the bladewrath inflicted were similar to those which killed Eleventoes.

Ne'aroff had *turned on* Eskander because he learned that more than just *dragons* (gold) Eskander was willing, in fact determined, to trade the Register for another artifiact, *the 
Eye of Alussh*. And frankly, there's just no profit in that business!

The Blackstaff reconfirmed the team's instructions that they were to find Eleventoes' killer **and** find Eskander and the Infernal Register, if it exists.

**Manny**'s contact at the Order of Magists and Protectors, Fakahr Plotz, explained that the bladewrath's magic and the residue found on Eleventoes' corpse, had hints of *dunamis*: a powerful source of magic that is rarely manifest on this plane, but is more common on other planes of existance and *other material planes*...

> Dunamis is "the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. ... Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possibly timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.

**Talib** continued to build rapport with the Bregan D'aerthe, providing healing and working them for information. A small uproar has taken the guild, as apprently they had some *financial* interest in the *Eyecatcher*, the flagship of the Sea Maidens Faire, a veritable floating carnival. They had little use for Ne'aroff and Talib could not find any obvious interest in Eskander or the Infernal Register.

**Gunmetal** continued to investigate the most unfamiliar name on Eleventoes' list: *Roris Wildshard*.From his workshop and various taverns, Gunmetal learned that Wildshard is a *character of interest*, a scoundrel of sorts, possibly a minor mercenary, who had, until recently made his base in Neverwinter. 

Doing some deduction, the team decided to follow-up on the background of the Infernal Register and Eskander, both of which led them back to Cavalier Villa, where they first met Eskander and the cult had been trying to summon Asmodeus. Most of *the cult* was deemed *harmless*, fined and turned loose. Only **Selene Maureal**, the wife of Germain DeLaurents, remained in custody. She knew very little, but the team was able to connect the cult, well really DeLaurents to being affiliated, possibly even sponsored by a mysterious drow named *Naal*. All she knew of him was that he had deep pockets, was interested in *the cult* and she suggested that he was somehow connected to the Cassalanters.

The **Cassalanters** were one of two noble families whom Talib's sources thought might be worth following up with in their investgiation. The Cassalanters are are a noble house of long-standing in Waterdeep. They carry a lot of political clout and sway. While they have never been formally connected any wrong doing, there has long been whispers that they had nefarious dealings of a sort.

One of the names on Eleventoes list was Hansel Orethax, who is also a known solicitor and representative of many powerful noble houses, in particular he has made a lot of money working for the Cassalanters.

## The Fall of the Yawning Portal (March 20. 2022) 
#### The Fall of the Yawning Portal
Blackstaff summoned the team to let them know that with what they had uncovered that she thought they might want a little more muscle. She arranged for them to meet Bobbin Porrigepot, who would provide reliable back-up. Porrigepot would meet them at the Yawning Portal, where he was keeping an eye on Mannix.

When the dust settled and all the parties were in place, the majority of Eleventoes list had walked into the tavern: Orus, Crystal, Harmish, Nashir and of course, Mannix. Only the assassin Hardbottom, the lawyer Orethax and the mysterious Wildhard *weren't at the bar!* Additionally, the left over crew from Krentz warehouse team were also in the bar and almost immediately started a fight with Force Grey. A legitimate ballroom ball broke out and as is the way with the Yawning Portal, as tempers flared, one of the resident trolls crept out of the pit.

Finally, Mannix put caused a distraction and put an end to the commmotion, drawing everyone's attention to *why they were there in the first place*. Apparently the rest of those gathered *and a mysterious halfling* had made arrangements to meet Eskander (or Mannix) at the Portal in order to retrieve the Garnet Eye of Alussh and whomever remained standing to present it could trade it and a fee for the Register.

The Garnet, they were told, was below... in the troll pit! Crystal and two of her minions, Orus - who was not working with the Zhents and Nashir went down into the pit. During the scrum, the halfling had disappeared. With two formidable adversaries... and Nashir... hot on the trail of the Garnet Eye, Force Grey deided to make a tatical retreat... and follow-up on Plan A.

Plan A had been to take a long rest (*old man nap*) and then collect the scrolls of Locate Creature that the Order of Magists and Protectors were creating for them, which they would use to scour the city to find Eskander.

In all, aside from the *letting the evil guys go after the potentially powerful artifiact* without check or supervision, the plan had merit. The team (minus Bobbin) started in the North and began to wind their way circuitiously down the city on horse (or mechanical raptor). It was fairly quick work until they drew near the Yawning Portal.

Manny had a special scrool that allowed the non-spellcaster to use *locate* spell. After hours of searching, to his surprise an orange *trail* began to lead him towards the Portal. 

Meanwhile, the others rendezvoused on the outskirts of a large crowd, gathering  aruond the Portal. The Portal, on the other hand was gone! The tavern and much of the closest buildings appeared to have collapsed into a giant sinkhole!

Gunmetal, having determined that Manny's scroll was specifically designed to be an augmented spell. The spell led Gunmetal through an orange-hued vision in which it appeared that he was seeing through someone else's eyes. From his vantage and the process of elimination, he was looking from Nashir's point-of-view as they descended into the troll pit.

>They dispatched three trolls and found a small door that lead to another chamber. Inside the chamber they found a group of hobgolins defending the opening of, what appeared to be a mine. However, the mine enterance lay flat in the ground, almost defying any common sensibility. The vision began to wind down the mine...

It appeared that the entirety of Yawning Portal and the building around it had been pulled into the mine shaft that Gunmetal had descibed. Tons of debris was piled on top of the shaft, and had crushed both of the chambers below the tavern.

After the team exhausted every option to get through the portal (that they could have just easily descended a few hours earlier), they determined that it was virtually impossible to get through the wreckage.

Talib left to follow up on a lead he had gotten from the Bregan D'earthe, trading on the idea that the *legend of Alussh* was an ancient legend in the area and the name seemed to be derivative of the archaic drow word *Alush* which meant *lustful* or *wanton*. His contact, *Berrian*, gave him the name Cre'eal, a *historian* who could be found at the Firefly Emporium. Talib went to the Emporium, which was an open-air market that housed semi-permanent shops beneath a circus-like canopy. When Talib arrived, the market was just beginning to open, and the small shop that he had been directed to, was still closed. 

The team rendevoused, reconnoitered and then retreated to Gunmetal's workshop where the gnome cast the locate spell again, hoping to gain more insight to what happened at the Portal.

>The group continued to descend down the mineshaft where they encountered more hobgoblins and a series of ***really well planned and thought out*** challenges and traps, chamber after chamber until the reached the vault, where they found the Garnet Eye of Alussh (and another cool challenge). Seelix's two minions had been killed along the way, both she and Orus were were wounded and it appeared that *Nashir* was *faking* an injury... as they went to retrieve the Garnet Eye, the mysterious halfling appeared, literally stepping out of the shadows!
>
> The tenuious alliance was suddenly, but predictably shattered as the party turned on one another to get the Garnet. For the most part Orus and Crystal appeared focused on each other and the halfling, as Nashir, who had seemed little more than a nuisance throughout the adventure moved into position. 
> As he did, he moved in front a door that had a mirrored surface, in the reflection the image shifted, became cloudy... from the cowardly Nashir, to a strange orange blur, to ***Eskander!*** and back.
> 
>The halfling went for the Garnet Eye. *Nashir/Eskander* went for the halfling, who was suddenly surrounded by darkness. <Something> happpened, violent things. When the darkness cleared, the halfling was running, with a shadowy trail towards one of the three doors on the other side of the chamber. The ceiling began to collapse, Orus and Seelix kept fighting as the chamber crumbled around them.
>
> *Nashir/Eskander* chased after it and then suddenly the halfling stepped the shadows and vanished! He turned his attention to the chamber collapsing around him, he watched as there was a moment of hesitation and then instead of fleeing, Crystal Seelix and Orus continued their battle.
>
>And then the vision ended.

To be continued...

* Who or *what* is that halfling?
* What the heck is going on with *Nashir/Eskander*?
* Naal and the Cassalanters...?
* So... what about **Alussh**...
