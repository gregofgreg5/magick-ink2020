## Who would name a place *Squalor*?

### We might need those wagons later
*It's like you guys are collecting wagons* I get it, mix in more treasure.

After careful scrutiny, Force Grey decided to leave the creature, *whatever it was* behind and carry on following the orc tracks. The trail went on winding through the hills and low lands until it led to the top of the hills.

Below, they could see the base of what was clearly once a great tower surrounded by the rancid squalidness of the orc tribe. Refuse and broken parts of various plundered items lay strewn all about he area around the ruins. Four wolves were feasting on a handful of various carcasses. They could see two more wagons, one tethered to a horse and another sitting beside it. They could hear horses on the other side of the tower. Walking around the site were three orcs.

Gunmetal Grey was almost giddy with excitement. Along the journey he had plotted and planned, schemed even. One by one, with each team member,he went over the plan, *the war wagon*. Looking down, the incline made it even better than he had ever imagined.

Quickly, Gunmetal instructed Grosh to break down parts of the wagon while he and Talib would mend it back together in a new, more nefarious form. The mundane, innocent wagon that first went down this road a few days ago with the orcs, was transformed into veritable death machine! Gunmetal directed Talib and they equipped the battleaxes and javelins from the orc raiders, where they could either be used as weapons as part of the wagon or quickly released to be thrown! They loaded the back of the wagon with cargo to give it some mass. A harness was created for the mighty minotaur, Grosh. 

At his *request*, really more of a demand, a quick-release was built into the harness.

Another quick change to the plan was thrown in, with Talib taking Gunmetal's place on the back of the wagon. From there, Talib could cast [Shield of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield-of-faith) on the Minotaur. A protective gleaming, field of tiny diamond-like crystals shrouded Grosh and made him and his plate armor seem even larger.

They looked over the field and Grosh drew up a plan that involved driving straight downhill at a full (*I really want to say gallop*) run and kicking into high gear right before they entered the field.

The wolves, too busy eating from the fresh carcasses, didn't notice the approaching danger. Which, to be honest, was half of their job. It was almost too late when the orc realized what was happening. He heard Grosh's war cry and felt the ground shaking and another thunderous roar from Talib's [thermaturgy spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thaumaturgy). The orc looked up, but the minotaur was already upon him. The orc never even saw the axe that swung threw him as Grosh flung his body, split to the waist, over his head. Blood and guts were spewed everywhere.

In addition to the two other orcs, a larger orc emerged from the ruins. Adorned in a thicker, woven hide armor, carrying a greataxe, he bellowed. *The Orc's First Warrior* of the tribe came out to join the battle. And from a cave on the hillside, another orc emerged, dressed in greasy, flamboyant skins, with a feathered plum and six small skulls sewn into a crown around his head. In his hand an old weathered staff, with more skins wrapped around it and feathers and dried talons at top. *An orc shaman*

"Damn casters" Manny cursed at  him.

Talib started the battle using his ***spectral weapon*** which was so effective in the last battle, but not so much today. Gunmetal turned to his **arrowless bow**, using the stash of plain, ol' ordinary rocks that he had been collecting along the way and schlepping with him. But like Talib, he also had trouble *finding his range*. Maybe he should try *more exotic ammunition*.

Another orc fell beneath Grosh's mighty weapon. Manny engaged the shaman. And another orc emerged from the ruins, this one large, like the First Warrior, but somehow even more impressive. Clad in studded leather, wielding a scimitar, the blade shining and shimmering in the bright day light. Smarter than some folk, the wolves knew a lost cause when they saw one, scared off by the horned, menacing figure of Grosh and the ground-shaking ***thermaturgy*** was enough for them to beat paws and flee.

However, undeterred, almost as if it were on a mission, a [basilisk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/basilisk), emerged from the shaman's cave. A large lizard, just over ten feet long and four feet tall with bared teeth and terrible spines it came out and began to attack Force Grey.

***Did you know...*** even if you know it's a basilisk, even if you know that it's gaze can turn a man to stone, it's really hard to look away from this kind of monstrosity especially as it advances on you and your colleagues. And hisses, like a terrible whine - a high pitched whine.

Talib knows. Manny knows. Gunmetal knows. *Well, they know now*. Heck, Talib knows a few times in fact.

What they didn't know was that the basilisk was *newly formed, recently summoned*... a little weaker even. It's fearsome gaze was dilute, buying them a few, extra moments, allowing them to will their way free of the menacing gaze.

The battle raged, with members of Force Grey falling and fighting off the effects of the monster. The First Warrior fell. The shaman fell. And another creature emerged from the cave.

A lumbering, towering monstrosity. An [Owlbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/owlbear) roared into the battle. A serrated beak and razor-sharp talons, the large beast moved in on Force Grey.

At the end, Force Grey stood victorious, the orc pack and two strange beasts lay dead around the camp. Grosh was his usual, fearsome, lethal force and standing beside him this time was Manny, who stepped up and cleaved his way through the orcs and the owlbear. The basilisk went down, beneath Gunmetal's aim, but was a concerted team effort. 

### Shaman's cave

While Grosh went to investigate the tower, Talib went into search the shaman's cave. No stranger to magic and an experienced Waterdeep investigator, Talib was initially taken aback. Floating above a pit with green flame and embers was a staff. Illuminated in the same eerie glow, two creatures were beginning to form beneath it, in front of the pit.

Without hesitation, Talib reached out and grabbed the staff. There was some resistance, it held firm for a split second and then came free. The pit went dark, the glow dissipated and the staff went from hot to lukewarm to cold in his hands in seconds.

With the glow, the creatures that were forming also vanished. Talib, who had a less than exemplary day in combat, let out a subtle sigh of relief, and began inspecting the staff. He quickly realized that what he held in his hands was Fazzanach's staff. That strange halfling who *begged* for their help.

The others arrived and Talib explained what he found and showed off the staff. A wizard of a sorts, in his own right, Gunmetal also took a turn looking over the staff. Marveling at the staff and the creatures that it had summoned, Grey wondered aloud whether or not they could trust the halfing. After all, he had told them that the staff wasn't useful.

Joined by Grosh, they conferred and decided that what he had actually said was closer to something like *he was preparing it to be a **vessel** for magic, but it wasn't magic yet. But he hoped that one day...* To which Gunmetal agreed.

Upon more discussion, it was posited, and mostly accepted that the shaman had known or figured out how to do something with or to the staff. And the shaman was clearly using it to summon monsters. Apparently back-to-back, one right after they other they assumed. First the basilisk, then the owlbear, followed by whatever was being manifest.

### tower ruins
The tower ruins were something else. Whether it was the anticipation of the ensuing melee or the heat of the battle, at first the trained investigators didn't put much mind to the broken down tower ruins in the center of the orc camp. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ieKAy49.jpg)

However when the frenzy of battle had subsided, and they were able to spend some time actually looking at the ruins, they all felt a bizarre, inexplicable sense of familiarity and, short of any other description, *creepiness* about the ruins. And... something *wrong*, something disturbing about the large structure.

The members of this team were all experience agents of Force Grey. Each of them were selected for this, *while for the other*, adventure because of their particular backgrounds.

**Manny** from his days investigating with the Watch, to his work after, Manny has come across a number of legends that talk about mysterious tower ruins outside of Waterdeep. He even had some friends in the Guard who made the *regular road trip* to shoo away miscreants and squatters. 
>One story has always stuck with him. The tower ruins have been a shattered state of repair as far back to the age of *[Aelinthaldaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aelinthaldaar)*, the capital of *[Illefarn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illefarn)*, the elf kingdom that once ruled this area. Ancient history, the elves destroyed their own city in -1100 DR (approximately 350 years before *now*). Even way back when, there was no reference to any actual tower, just the ruins. An Illefarn legend tells that before they made their presence widely known in the region, the drow had used the tower ruins, or this area in particular, as an outpost. They would get cleaned out periodically, but one drow clan or another would come back.

**Grosh** Even in his youth, hailing from the far East, Grosh had heard legends from the Sword Coast region. *Familiar* with the ways and lore of the duergar from his area he had heard tell of ruins of a tower that were so revered that he believed them to be mythical.

>*Blackcloack Hold* reigned for almost two hundred years and was established by the insane wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Between 171 and 308 DR, which ended about 1200 years before the Force Grey team were born and about 1000 years after their *now*, Blackcloak conducted a purging of the drow and duergar from Undermountain. It was legendarily very thorough. Legend has it that the tower ruins were the one refuge that these otherwise condemned and trapped tribes had to seek out. Very few made it to the ruins and Blackcloak's hunters who did make that far, never returned. No one knows what happened to those drow or duergar. It was assumed, that somehow, those few who managed to reach the tower escaped, maybe they went East. *And maybe some didn't...

**Talib** has been in Force Grey longer than any of the others on this team. Talib had had a lot of colleagues and associates in the Watch and Guard. As Talib walked around the ruins a lot of things came to mind. There was something obviously sinister about the ruins. Something powerful. But what kept coming to Talib's mind was:
>Waterdeep general policy had a regular City Guard that patrolled out to the *tower ruins* once every month or so. For the most part, it's routine duty, ride out, check the area for squatters or worse and ride back. Once the Guard patrol came upon a troop of Gith, who left them all for dead. One survived long enough to report the encounter, but the Gith were never seen again. There have been no known gith tribes in that frequent this area. After that, a Griffon Rider accompanied the patrol, in case there was a more potent presence. A couple of times a year, someone does get caught trying to set up a camp or outpost and gets thrown out. Rumors of ceremonies being trekked out to the ruins popped up occasionally, sometimes before and sometimes after the fact. When the authorities could, they discouraged it.

**Gunmetal Grey** Where he comes from, there are more legends and mysteries than reliable history. Sometimes. There is often more known about the backstory of a spell or an artifact, than the area surrounding it. So his head was full of lore and myths, but there was something about those ruins that make Gunmetal think of this one peculiar story.
>The legend of *the tower ruins* stretched back before time. Whatever the tower was, it was a place of great power, immense, beyond anything that was ever imaginable. It was said that it's destruction re-shaped the entire universe, that all of the land and sea around it and all of the things living, *and dead?* were re-formed. It is said that no one, in any kingdom or era, has ever tried to rebuild the tower or even build or establish settlement around the tower. *Strange things* befell those who spent too much time there. No matter whether they walked in the light or the dark. No one stayed very long. The existence of the tower ruins was more myth than a geographical fact, as no one had ever put it on a map. 

At least that was a story that Gunmetal had heard, from *where he was from*. And where he was from was so far away, so so far away, that these couldn't be those ruins, *could they*...?

Inside the ruins, Grosh found the orc's stash. The team quickly distributed the goods and loaded some of it back into their war wagon. Surprisingly, the war wagon survived the melee unscathed. They also added the orcs wagons to their own, doubling their wagon total. Huzzah!

The orcs had been using the ruins as the center of their base. Most of the orcs, lived outside and slept on mats or shallow carved out spaces in the ground. The team assessed that there were probably about 30 orcs total. From the looks of it, the chief made his home inside, near a fire pit.

The entire campsite, the ruins included were a mess.
