## Battle Royale Continues
### Manny's Time to Shine

Manny made his move, after tying his rope to a rapier (for weight, not stabbing) he tossed into the *strange liquid* as Grosh continued to struggle to the surface. Surrounded by the *dark Talib* and *dark *Gunmetal*, he shucked to the left and jived to the right before leaping ahead to the next platform. Nothing ever goes quite as planned, but a slip here or there, but this plan worked brilliantly.

Grosh, with the rapier in hand was able to swim easily towards the other side of the pool. Manny, for his part, made it to the other side and anchored for Grosh.

It was only right before he reached the sanctuary of the side that he lost his mojo and was pulled under, into the raving undertow. He and Manny could see what appeared to be terrible fish-like creatures made of the water, swimming, swarming around him. Pulling him further and further down.

Until suddenly Grosh popped back up and Manny helped to pull him to shore.

### Meanwhile, Gunmetal
Inspired, instead of dealing with the ferocious minotaur in front of him, whom he had already seen do horrific amounts of damage, Grey leaped back to the shore. 

Grey made an acrobatic roll on to the cement, popping up, readied for *dark Grosh*, but he was gone. Gunmetal looked across the pool and saw his comrades: Manny on the other side of the pool anchoring for Grosh. Grosh making his way to Manny and Talib... battling... *no one* in a fierce (?) knife duel.

He waited for a moment, watching the rest of Force Grey and the began to do what this team was built to do: investigate. The first thing he did was check out the statue of the large cat. Other than some bizarre markings, it was just a statue of a cat that appeared to be made of the same material as the floor and walls. On the other side, the base of the statue appeared very similar, if not exactly the same as the one that was intact, except that this one was shattered into rubble above the haunches. There was nothing outwardly sinister about the statues, but something about them bothered him. 

He turned his attention back to his companions, having realized a way that he could help them. Quickly he began to fashion a grappling device that he could use to help his partners cross the pool. All the while wary that every step he took might bring him closer to *dark Grosh*.

Initially he had planned on firing the length of the pool, but instead fired it over to assist Talib. After having watched Grosh pull himself over to the edge by Manny.

### Manny to the rescue

*Dark Manny* wastes almost no time slicing through Gunmetal's rope and the fierce battle between Talib and the dopleganger rages on. Meanwhile, as Grosh, holding on to Manny's rope struggled to get to shore, he slipped and was caught up in what appeared to be a whirlpool of invisible fish. The others could only watch as he sunk faster and deeper than he had the first time, being pulled down into the *liquid*.

Grosh could feel the *creatures* (?) swarming him, passing through his armor, brushing past him, *biting* (?) him, small pinches all over his body as he could see the surface fading away. And then darkness.

Manny, staring down, could only watch as Grosh sunk into the liquid, a swirl of activity around him. For a second it appeared that he was gone completely, and then Manny saw his the minotaur's mighty arms, first flailing and then swimming towards the surface. In a desperate effort, Grosh grabbed the rope and Manny helped pull him ashore.

Grosh and Manny quickly re-oriented themselves to help their companions across. Manny, seeing the validity of Grey's plan, fashioned another line to an arrow and fired the rope across the pool.

Grey carefully grabbed the rope and began to make his way across the platforms. He paused as soon as he hit the first platform, ready for the *dark mintoaur* but it never came. Cautiously, holding the rope, he continued from platform to platform.

Seeing the danger Talib was still mired in, Manny turned on his *darker image* and began throwing daggers at him. The *shadow Manny* was no match for the real thing and was quickly dispatched.

With the danger passed, Gunmetal and Talib both finally made it ashore. Not a moment too soon as they began to hear a creaking and cracking from the strange cat statue on the other side of the pool.

The outline of a door was on the opposite side of the entrance. Like the walls, the *door* appeared to be made out of some kind of concrete covered by ceramic. A closer examination, the *door* was more like a *door shape* carved into the wall. There was a visible seam, around what would be a door frame, but it appeared to be mere decoraction than an actual space between the door and the wall. The same appeared at the floor and ceiling. Quickly Manny checked the door for traps and *signs of life* with one of his daggers. He indicated that it was clear and before he could say anything else, the statue on the other room began to come alive, tentacles that were scantly outlined on the statue flared out above it's haunches.

Without a second of thought, Grosh reached out and put his hand on the door. And everything changed. A white light filled the eyes of the Tavernlords, there was a loud sound, like a high note from a musical horn. And then it stopped.

## Welcome to Thyrgarr Station
When they were able to come to their senses, when the light cleared and their ears stopped ringing, they immediately realized that they were no longer in the pool room. There was no moisture in the air, which smelled fragant and full of activity, bodies and food.

They were suddenlly standing at the entrance of some kind of busy hub of activity. There were people and creatures moving all over the room. *People* of all races: dwarves, humans, and even duergar and drow... Surprisingly a lot of duergar and drow milled about, with what could have been tiefling or demons and monsters: a ogre, mindflayers - not just one, but multiple mindflayres, what appeared to be a small group of trolls and a number of armored creatures that could be anything, they all seemed to move with purpose around the room.

Ten feet in front of the entrance was a large kiosk, with a large jet-black obelisk on either side and a marquee across the top for the kiosk. On these obelisks were dozens of characters in two columns, written in ancient undercommon. Inside the kiosk was another strange *slug-like* monster behind the desk. With a low, but cordial growl she called Force Grey over.

>"Well, well, what have we here. Look at you, you are certainly a face out of place... or shall we say time? Hmmm... Are you on a walkabout perhaps? Or just lost lambs? What brings you to Thygarr Station?"

She welcomed them to Thyrgarr Station and introduced herself as *Rahhzz* the *station dispatcher*. She looked them over carefully, observed and then confirmed that they had never been in an astral station before. Then she chuckled, a phlegm-filled almost grotesque chuckle. At her command a map of the station appeared.

After Force Grey tells them that they are from *Waterdeep 1492 DR*, she still looked at them like they were children staring aimlessly at the sun. Finally she asked for something that they had brought from their own time. Manny produced one of his mundane daggers, in the most non-threatening way possible and handed it over to her. She passed it over some *obviously* magic device on her desk. It produced a series of sounds and the desk changed colors a few times, she finally understood where they were from. and explained that the currency at Thyrgarr Station was souls. Souls were typically paid in various containers. Raahzz showed the party a handful of what looked like opals. A few dark maroon and a couple jet black opals. She explained, some companies have *lines of credit* established with the Astral Thruway and she gestured towards a group of armored travelers.

She explains that if they can not pay with any exchangeable currency, that they will have to go see the Senior Station Superintendent. When they indicate that they can not, she bids them to wait and someone will come along to escort them to the Station Superintendent.

While they were waiting Gunmetal walked around a little, staying close the other, but venturing out just enough to get a better lay of the land. He stopped when he almost ran into a 15 foot tall creature.

Gunmetal stopped in his tracks and backed away from the *man (?)*. By the time he got back to Force Grey, their escort had arrived. Almost as big as the armored giant, Deputy Gruntharaax, stroll towards them. Well-versed in the many kinds of creatures of darkness, they recognized the deputy as a [*Barluga*](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Barlgura) or a leaping demon. Except this particular Barluga was dressed from neck to leather-plated boots in the sharp black outfit of Thyrgarr Station Security. A badge or sigil of some sort hung on his large right breast. With *friendliness* that belied his appearance, and let's be honest, his nature, Gruntharaax greeted them and motioned Force Grey towards the Administrator's office.

## The Deal
The administration office was a mess. There were file cabinets all around the office and desk in the back. On the desk sat some kind of strange scrying device, or so they may have assumed, as the **Senior Station Superintendent Hycks** at the desk chewing on some kind of wand.

After hearing their story, the Superintendent gave them a very careful glance, finally nodding understanding and explained that they were luck, a ship arrived just the other day and was scheduled to depart in two days. They could no doubt book passage on the *Aurora* and be back *home* in no time. The fee
>Passage on an Astral Ship requires payment. Payment is always made in the form of souls. Souls can be leased, in which you can put your body *on ice* and lend your soul out for a year or you can sign over rights to your soul for a year (or more) after you die. Passage for this particular trip would be **two years**.

He looked them over again, even more carefully, in truth with a different *eye*, and told them or they could trade a powerful magical artifact if they had one.

Reluctantly Talib produced Fazzarnach's staff. Talib and Manny had already decided that they would accept the bargain. Gunmetal agreed shortly after. Only Grosh was reluctant to *lease* his soul. The team agreed that he should use the staff to get home and they turned it over Hycks.

The accord was agreed upon and Hycks other deputy, yr'ylleh, a mindflayer appeared behind the Superintendent. In his hands was three contracts and four vouchers of passage. He also produced a deed, for Grosh to sign over ownership of the staff along with the three contracts.

Hycks explained that entering the station, each of them already opened a blood contract with the Astral Thruway when they opened keyed the locking mechanism. All they needed was their signature (or mark). And with those marks the three of them *leased* their souls the the Thyrgarr Thruspace Engineers.

With their vouchers, they were assigned two staterooms in the lodging area. And a little bit of *time to kill* on Thyrgarr Station...
