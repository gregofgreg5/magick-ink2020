# In The Shadows of Waterdeep
## Part One (November 17. 2021) 
### The murder of Delfh Eleventoes
### The fifth day of Hammer in the year 1493
Six days after Manny, Talib and Gunmetal saved the world from Cavalier Villa. An old friend of Manny's, Delfh Eleventoes, a known ne'er-do-well and scoundrel, was found murdered.
 * Eleventoes wasa a known scoundrel and ne'er-do-well around Waterdeep.
 * He was also an agent of both the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, and the Court of Lords and Force Grey.
 * An accmoplished reprobate, with a big heart, he traveled in many of the same circles as Manny.
 * Thw two of them were occassinal collaborators, and trusted allies.
 * Manny was one of the few people who knew that Eleventoes was an agent of Force Grey.
 * While he never *knew*, Manny suspected that Eleventoes also worked for the Order.
### Set-up: Eleventoes Investigation: The Infernal Register
 * Blackstaff Vajra Safahr summoned Manny, Talib & Gunmetal to Blackstaff Tower, Force Grey headquarters.
 * While it is uncommon for Force Grey to operate as formal teams, she brought you all together because she thought you would have a common interest and a lget-up in the investigation.
 * On 1493-1-02, Eleventoes was approached by a drow named Ne'aroof approached Eleventoes trying to gauge his interest on acquiring (bidding on) a legendary artifact, the *Infernal Register*.
 * The Infernal Register are rumored to be a set of scrolls that belong to the forces of Asomdeus, whose allies on various planes have secreted away caches of powerful items for the armies of Dagum (_Asmodeus' home plane, but you knew that_).
 * Allegedly, there are *advanced scout* teams that go out and secure these caches for Asmodeus' army and can *scribe* new locations to these scrolls continually.
 * Elventoes took the bait and Ne'aroff led him to his contact, a man calling himself ***Eskander Behrani***, who did not produce the scrolls but did show him two nevarious magic items: The _Gauntlets of Flaming Fury_ and a _Lesser Helm of Dispater_, claiming that he had recovered these (among other things) from a cache near Waterdeep.
 * Of course Eleventoes recognized the name Eskander Behrani and reported to his contact with Force Grey and sent a *magical sketch* of the vilain for verification, assuming that they would bring in Manny to confirm.
 * That was two days ago.
### The murder
 * Last night the contact was supposed to meet Eleventoes in his suite, but found him dead in his study instead. The contact alerted Force Grey and after questioning was allowed to leave and *disappear*, cleared of suspicion in the death.
 * Manny had heard about the murder, through *a guy he knows* and had the opportunity to get over to the flat to investigate.
 * Elventoes had one set of visible wounds, a pair of cuts across his chest - deep enough to cut him to the bone. 
 * There was blood on his clothing, but no other sign of a struggle or combat. 
 * There was also no blood left in Elventoes' body.
 * The study had been *rifled through*, there were items that appeared to be strewn around the room, while no one had really been in the study, other than the contact, with any kind of regularity, because there were still many valuable items and tomes in the room, that burgulary or at least random burglary was not in play here.
 
 ### Ne'aroff
  * A drow with a history of low-level criminal activity
  * A *loose* connection to the Bregan D'aerthe (*I mean, he's a drow...*)
  * Working with/for Eskander, looking to build up bidders for the Infernal Register
 
 ### Eleventoes' Residence
 * Talib found a hidden compartment in a bookcase
 * Talib should have found the scrolls that Manny found in the hidden compartment in the desk (DM error, I owe him one)
 * Manny uncovered a hidden compartment with a poison dart trap, but managed to save and not be poisoned
 * Gunmetal searched the entrances 
 
### Skewered Dragon
 * Gunmetal met a human and half-orc team who told him that Ne'aroff had been coming in regularlly talking about his *big score*

### The Order of the
 * Manny found that Barnabus was not available, but his retainer was willing to help him find Eleventoes' killer
 * Despite any *misigivings* the Order might have about Manny in general
 * Manny asked about weapons that could drain the blood of their victims
 * He learned that there are many weapons that can do that, but none specifically that are known to be out in the world right now

### Bregan D'aerthe
 * Talib learned that Ne'aroff is known at the guild and isn't highly respeccted
 * The BD think very little of him, in fact, he has been hired to do the occassional, very minor errand - like accompanying others to deliver a message to *bulk up the entourage*
 * Ne'aroff is also employed by at the **_Old Xoblob's_ **curious shop
