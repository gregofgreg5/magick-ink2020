# In The Shadows of Waterdeep
## Chapter One: The murder of Delfh Eleventoes
### Part One (November 17. 2021) 
### The fifth day of Hammer in the year 1493
Six days after Manny, Talib and Gunmetal saved the world from Cavalier Villa. An old friend of Manny's, Delfh Eleventoes, a known ne'er-do-well and scoundrel, was found murdered.
 * Eleventoes was a known scoundrel and ne'er-do-well around Waterdeep.
 * He was also an agent of both the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors and Force Grey.
 * An accmoplished reprobate with a big heart, he traveled in many of the same circles as Manny.
 * Thw two of them were occassinal collaborators, and trusted allies.
 * Manny was one of the few people who knew that Eleventoes was an agent of Force Grey.
 * While he never *knew*, Manny suspected that Eleventoes also worked for the Order.
### Eleventoes & The Infernal Register
 * Blackstaff Vajra Safahr summoned Manny, Talib & Gunmetal to Blackstaff Tower, Force Grey headquarters.
 * While it is uncommon for Force Grey to operate as formal teams, she brought you all together because she thought you would have a common interest and a lget-up in the investigation.
 * On 1493-1-02, Eleventoes was approached by a drow named **_Ne'aroof_** approached Eleventoes trying to gauge his interest on acquiring (bidding on) a legendary artifact, the *Infernal Register* or helping him find interested buyers.
 * The Infernal Register are a legendary set of scrolls that were created by the forces of Asomdeus that denote the whereabouts of caches of powerful items secreted away by Asmodeus' forces across the planes of existance.
 * Allegedly, there are *advanced scout* teams that continually go out and secure these caches for Asmodeus' army and can *scribe* new locations to these scrolls.
 * Elventoes took the bait and Ne'aroff led him to his contact, a man calling himself ***Eskander Behrani***, who did not produce the scrolls but did show him two nevarious magic items: The _Gauntlets of Flaming Fury_ and a _Lesser Helm of Dispater_, claiming that he had recovered these (among other things) from a cache near Waterdeep.
 * Of course Eleventoes recognized the name Eskander Behrani from the reports *to be on the look out for...*, hereported to his contact with Force Grey and sent a *magical sketch* of the vilain for verification, assuming that they would bring in Manny to confirm.
 * That was two days ago.
### The murder of Delph Eleventoes
 * Last night the contact was supposed to meet Eleventoes in his suite, but found him dead in his study. 
 * The contact alerted Force Grey and after questioning was allowed to leave and *disappear*, cleared of suspicion in the death.
 * Manny had heard about the murder, through *a guy he knows*, and had the opportunity to get over to the flat to investigate.
 * Elventoes had one set of visible wounds, a pair of cuts across his chest - deep enough to cut him to the bone.
 * Initial investigators believed the wounds to be caused by some kind of large dagger or short sword. 
 * There was blood on his clothing, but no other sign of a struggle or combat. 
 * There was also no blood left in Elventoes' body.
 * The study had been *rifled through*, there were items that appeared to be strewn around the room, while no one had really been in the study, other than the contact, with any kind of regularity, because there were still many valuable items and tomes in the room, that burgulary or at least random burglary was not in play here.
 
 ### Ne'aroff
  * A drow with a history of low-level criminal activity
  * A *loose* connection to the Bregan D'aerthe (*I mean, he's a drow...*)
  * Working with/for Eskander, looking to build up bidders for the Infernal Register
 
 ### Eleventoes' Residence
 * Talib found a hidden compartment in a bookcase
 * Talib should have found the scrolls that Manny found in the hidden compartment in the desk (DM error, I owe him one)
 * Manny uncovered a hidden compartment with a poison dart trap, but managed to save and not be poisoned
 * Gunmetal searched the entrances and found no signs of forced entry, although it did appear that some of the mundane and magical wards that had been set to protect the suite had been disabled, *not tripped* or disarmed.
 
### Skewered Dragon
 * Gunmetal met a human and half-orc team who told him that Ne'aroff had been coming in regularlly talking about his *big score*
 * Gunmetal's new friends told him that Ne'aroff tries to *be a big man*, but is often broke, claims to work with the Bregan D'aerthe

### The Order of Magists and Protectors
 * Manny found that Barnabus was not available, but his retainer was willing to help him find Eleventoes' killer, despite any *misigivings* the Order might have about Manny in general
 * Manny asked about weapons that could drain the blood of their victims
 * He learned that there are many weapons that can do that, but none specifically that are known to be out in the world right now

### Bregan D'aerthe
 * Talib learned that Ne'aroff is known at the guild and isn't highly respeccted
 * The BD think very little of him, in fact, he has been hired to do the occassional, very minor errand - like accompanying others to deliver a message to *bulk up the entourage*
 * Ne'aroff is also employed by at the **_Old Xoblob's_ ** curious shop

### A genuine Force Grey mystery...
> **Who killed Eleventoes?**
> 
> **Does Eskander really have the Infernal Register?**
> 
> *Is the Infernal Register real?*
> 
> *...and what about Eskander?*

## Part Two (December 8, 2021) 
### On the trail of Ne'aroff 
### Everyone rendezvoused at the Skewered Dragon
* Talib sent Manny to Xobolob's Old Oddities and Curios Shop.
* Xoblob's is a known fence/trafficker in stolen items: mostly mundane stuff. For the most part the magic items he deals in are moved legitimately (the Order of...) keep a pretty close eye on that part of his traffic.
* Manny saw Krentz, a known Zhentarim tough guy, talking to Xoblob.
* Xoblob is complaining that this guy hasn't found Ne'aroff he's supposed to find.
* Ne'aroff often worked out of an abandoned warehouse on the docks.
* It was known that Eskander also worked out of at least one warehouse on the docks.

### Back at the Skewered Dragon
* Gunmetal spent too much time at the Skewered Dragon and is two sheets to the wind.
* Talib wondered, if everyone was looking for him, *why would Ne'aroff show up here?*.
* Gunmetal suggested that they go look at wealthy folk who might be looking to purchase magic items.
* Talib said he’d check with *his sources*.
* While they continued to wait, Krentz and a couple of his team showed up at the Dragon.
* Two drow also showed up and parked themselves conspicuously at the bar, watching the comings and going of the other patrons.

### The Docks
* The team followed Krentz and his squad to the docks, where they stumbled upon them breaking and entering a broken down warehouse on a pier.
* ***Talib*** recognized the company name on the warehouse as being one that had been associated with Eskander's import business.
* With Eskander's boat set on fire as a distraction, **Mannny** swam over and snuck into the building to reconoiter.
* There were six villains, including two left outside on the pier. And... hiding in the boxes was... Ne'aroff!
> And we all no nothing good ever happens in games like this,  in *warehouses*…

## Part Three (January 12, 2022)
## Warehouse Ambush: Ambushing the ambush
* Manny continued his stealth-antics and "Come with me if you want to live" Ne'aroff. The two them made a mad dash escape into the hole in the floor.
* Gunmetal was still inebriated, but the Robo-raptor pulled it's weight.
* Talib made the most of the cover around the dock.
* Manny reached the dock and demanded the Zhents surrender to their authority.
	* ***Krentz*** retreated into the warehouse.
	* Given the opportunity escape, ***Lu Siphor*** swam off.
	* ***The Eel***, one of the more dangerous of Krentz crew, had exhausted his primary arsenal, and surrendered.
	* ***One-eyed Charlie***, overwhelmed by the dwindling numbers on his side, surrendered.
	* ***Lucky*** made a break for it and raced away into the night.
	* ***Sticky*** didn't make it long enough to surrender.

### The Bladewraith
Manny & Talib went after Krentz in the warehouse. They found him dead, with a wound cut into his chest, similar to the two that struck down Eleventoes.
They were able to surprise the *sheet of darkness* and slay the Bladewraith. To their surprise, upon it's defeat, it turned into a simple blade!

* Ne'aroff reluctantly surrendered into the custody of Force Grey and began singing like a canary.
	* Ne'aroff claimed to be working **with** Eleventoes!
	* He had known Eskander for a long time, so when he the smuggler showed up last week with a scheme that sounded like a windfall.
	* But Eskander was different and seemed to grow darker and more disturbing each time he met with him.
	* He became even more dismayed when it started to sound like that Eskander was looking for something other than gold.
	* He was supposed to deliver something from Xoblob to Eskander, but Eskander didn't show.
	* Ne'aroff started to work with Eleventoes to get out the scheme.
	* He was there when Eleventoes was killed. He told them that he was killed by this living darkness.
	* He has a list of the people that Eleventoes was investigating.

### Mysteries remain.
* Force Grey has a pretty good idea of **how** Eleventoes was killed and by ***what***...
* It was surmised that this *thing* (the Bladewraith) was doing someone else's bidding, **but who???**
* **Where is Eskander? And what is he up to?**
* Oh yeah, and then there's the business of this **Infernal Register*...
