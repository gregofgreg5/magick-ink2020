## Episode Two: Doggo has hit points - December 17, 2020

Manny and Gunmetal Grey investigated the bookcases and rest of the foyer throughly for other exits or hidden secrets, but they found nothing. All that was left to do was to go through the door. A careful investigation revealed that it was free of traps, mimics and wasn't locked.

What was once a Great Hall has been caught up in flames. A torrential fire has engulfed the entire back portion of the room. However the team noticed that, on their  side of the room, only about 80 feet away, the temperature felt just above *normal*. More investigation was required. Gunmetal cast *detect magic* and the fire was indeed magic, as were Ahani and Eskander. To investigate further, he sent his robo-doggo to determine, who likely sees itself something like this:

The Steel Defender (aka *Robbo-doggo*) helped to determine that the closer that one got to the fire, the hotter it was, more so than one might normmally expect. In other words, it was okay on the other side of the room where they came in, but right next to the fire, it was **really hot**. The team also noticed a set of footprints that bisected the room. They seemingly started somewhere near one of the doors on the left (the one above the fireplace, if anyone was keeping score) and led directly to the door on the wall on the right side. The footprints were hard to miss, as they appeared to be steaming. Two options were considered, that they were so hot that they were still burning or that they were somehow wet, producing steam. Further investigation revealed that it was indeed steam and the footprints were frozen. They were also magic, as was the sheet of ice on the door at the end of the foot path.

### The Ice Parlor
The door on the right was indeed frozen shut, with a layer of ice at least two inches thick. Goredon did what he does and crashed into it, substantially cracking the ice. Talib used his righteous flame to assist and the two of them took down the ice barrier without much pause. On the other side of the door they were surprised to see a heavy snow fall and a furnished recreation room covered in ice and snow. The room included a grand piano, a very comfortable sitting area and even a nook where a checkers/chess board had been set up. Also in the room were three frozen skeletons and three strange looking kobolds. These weren't your every day healthy looking greyish, brownish, redish kobold. They were a strange slate blue/grey color, everything about them screamed "cold".

Two of the ice kobolds (*that's what they were*) were playing checkers. The one on the right was "winning" and also cheating, a lot. The third was sitting in the sitting area reading an atlas of Faerun. One of the ice skeletons (*look I just call'em like I see'em*) was banging on the piano. The other two were pulling things out of the cabinets around the room.

Goredon was able to wander over to the pianist without causing a fuss. Everything seemed copacetic until Talib went over to inspect the checkers players. As soon as they saw his infernal looking form, the two ice kobolds (*yes, we're sticking with that*) leapt up and started screaming obsenities at him. And just like that, it was on. Seriously, though there aren't pages and pages in the rule books of *debate tables* and *synonyms* there's combat tables and weapons. A fierce battle was kinda the expected outcome here.

And fierce it was. The (ice) skeletons and kobolds battled with short swords, and bows or slings. The kobolds also cast some kind of wicked ice shard spell. Similar to *ice knife* but instead of the shard exploding, it sent a painful chill through their victims. The (ice) villains seemed particularly interested in attacking Talib and Goredon. Gunmetal Grey spent much of the fight letting his Steel Defendeer do his melee for him, instead remaining outside the cold room with the two *rescued* strangers.

For their part, neither Ashani nor Eskander wanted anything to do with going into the room and certainly wanted nothing to do with any combat. Finally, as the battle began to wind down and as the great room seemed to be getting hotter, Gunmetal convinced them to enter the room.

After the ice skeletons and ice kobolds were dispatched and throughly searched, the investigators found nothing of interest on any of them. Clearly they had been set out to perform some task, dressed for action, but unarmored. Fully loaded to bear with both weapons (mundane) and spells. Goredon collected the contraband to make sur that they didn't *fall into the wrong hands* and maybe add them to his collection or sell them as the case may be. One of you suggested checking to see if the *kobold figurine* had any effect if it was placed on the chess board squares. *Alas, still no one was brave enough to actually touch the fine carvings.* So we don't know the answer to that exquisite question. After searching the room, they decided to check on the great room, only to find that the flames had indeed spread even further and seemed even hotter. They threw the bodies of the ice skeletons into the fires to see if their cold nature would slow down the flames to no avail.

With the inferno apparently *hellbent* on cutting off their other exit, the party carefully checked the doors to the south. They were neither magic, trapped nor alive. They did however lead to another frozen room, with even more snow fall and two ominous portals. Surely there couldn't be any other dangers lurking inside, could there?
