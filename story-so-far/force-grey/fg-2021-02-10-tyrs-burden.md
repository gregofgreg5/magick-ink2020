# Waterdeep circa -750DR part 01

## *Orcs are big too? WTF.* 	
### Orc Hunt (February 10, 2021)

### Preface
>A band of orcs had been raiding the outskirts or *easy targets* around **Tyr's Burden**. The raids started in the farms and area in the north east and have moved down south and back up again. The raids have occured about once a month. Usually about a dozen orcs come through and are easily fended off by the constable,  his deputies and (a lot of) brave citizens. *Folk in Tyr's Burden aren't anyone's victims!*


Tyr's Burden was a very small hamlet that was founded by a handful of pioneers looking to start anew on the brave frontier. With dreams of creating a farming community, to do Tyr's work, they moved west. The founders of Tyr's Burden came from the outskirts of a town called ***Morinden***, which had become increasingly oppressive over the past few years. The lord of Morinden had steadily increased taxes on their produce and had even begun to tax the church. 

Less than a day's walk to the ocean and two days to Waterdeep Mountain by way of the Long Road, Tyr's Burden was established just over a decade ago and it has indeed become a small, thriving farming community. Farming produce and artisan crafts were the mainstay of Tyr's Burden at this time, though there were those beginning to explore fishing enterprises.

Tyr's Burden was governed by a Civic Council. The council was traditionally made up of a mayor, curate (religious leader), constable, and at least one arcane specialist. 

**Mayor Tyson Harper** was also the leader of the caravan of pioneers who headed west out of Morinden. Back in Morinden he was a deputy for the sheriff whose job it was to police the outskirts of the rapidly growing metropolis. He is the twin brother of Maurice Harper and lifelong friend of Horace Stratford. In fact, thought Maurice will not ever talk about it, in their youths the three of them were part of a semi-celebrated adventuring party that operated out of Morinden. He *retired* to the sheriffs.

**Curate Maurice Harper** always wanted to be a priest, a cleric of Tyr. He entered seminary as soon as he could and found that as an acolyte he was sent out to the world to spread the word of Tyr and gain experience, a period of his life that he never talks about. Once he *retired* from that life, he was able to take more active role in the church, where he excelled and quickly became one of the most sought out brothers in the order. Performing ministry to the rural outskirts that his brother served as deputy, he is credited to leave 

**Constable* Horace Stratford** was also a sheriff's deupty back in Morinden. He liked the idea of being a lawman, but didn’t do so well with taking orders. He didn’t last very long as a deputy. And afterwards, he found himself between careers, as much as on any path, until they headed west. He wasn't sure that he wanted this job at first. But he had known Tyson (the Mayor) and Maurice (Curate of Tyr) since they were all kids. So when Tyson, who had stood as his second when he married Felicia and vis-versa, was adamant about this little project, he figured he had to go and he may as well have a job. They don't talk about it very often, but the three of them: Horace, Maurice and Tyson were adventurers, *explorers* in their own right when they were younger. In fact, the other two never talk about those days, but if you try hard enough you might get a story out of Horace. As the Constable, he is fair, though there really hasn't been a lot of trouble in the hamlet.

*Enchanter* Charmane, sorcerer and Tyna Wildheart, the *Archdruid* round out the Civic Council.

It didn't take long for the people of Tyr's Burden to embrace the strangers. At first they thought the Force Grey task force was a traveling minstrel show. Mayor Tyson and the Constable knew better, almost immediately. *Like, as they say, recognized like* and they were thrilled to see these clearly able adventurers. Exactly what they needed for this orc problem. And, again they knew *lost souls* when they see them.

For Force Grey, it seemed like a good trade while they figured out where they were. When they were. And how they were going to get home. In exchange for room and board, they agreed to help defend the hamlet from the orcs.

Force Grey learned that it had been about three and half weeks since the orcs last attack. They attacked irregulalry, but about a month a part. The Constable thought that they were coming from the north, so they set Force Grey up in tents on the northern outskirts. 

Tyr's Burden's Constable had five deputies. Constable Stratford didn't like it, but it was said that his five deputies were the young men who weren't any good at farming and worse at everything else. As far as he was concerned, they did their best, and were more than capable for most of Tyr's Burden's needs. Still, acknowledging this, the Constable was very happy for Force Grey's help fortifying the hamlet's defenses.

Manny and Grosh worked on training and arming the deputies and as many of the townfolk as possible. Gunmetal Grey assisted building up fortifications. Meanwhile, Talib was making friends with Curate Harper, the jury was still out on who was trying to convert whom. Or if either made any headway. But both would agree mutual respect was earned.

Gunmetal also made acquaintances with Daerin Stonebottom, one of the few dwarves who left Melairbode to live in Tyr's Burden. Stonebottom owned and operated one of the two dwarven workshops in the hamlet. The other was run by the Longbeard family and was in operation around the clock. Steelbottom on the other hand was a little eccentric and preferred to keep to himself. He had a few good friends in the hamlet, Tyna Wyldheart and the Constable to name two.

Stonebottom had a long lasting fascination with artificers. He met one once who was passing through Melairbode, about a hundreds of years ago, when he was just a kid. He was ecstatic to get to spend time with Gunmetal and watch him work. And get to know more about Doggo.

One morning, towards the end of the week, ***Leopold Fazzanach***, an eccentric, young halfling wizard begged the party's favor. On the most recent raid the orcs stole a staff that he had been working on. He tells them that it was important to his work, if they could return it to him, he would be **so grateful.**

When pressed, the wizard explained that the staff had no real power, yet. He was working off of an ancient spell lore that he had discovered and was preparing the staff to be enchanted. This process intrigued Gunmetal, sounding to him like maybe some long-forgotten arcane version of his own sects imbue practice. 

Force Grey could see the man's desperation and they judged him to be trustworthy, so they agreed to look for and return the staff if they found it. Very excited, he drew them quick sketch of the *approximately three-foot long staff*.

### Except that's north west

After all was said and done, they waited over a week before they saw any action. They set up Doggo to work a perimeter and volunteers from the deputies and town folk stayed up to sound the alarm. 

The orc raiding party came from the north, but went behind the low hills to the east to the farms on the South East. There were a dozen orcs and they had brought a wagon drawn by two horses.

Talib unleashed his flaming mace.

The head of the mace burst into flames! The tiefling and his fiery weapon cut a terrifying image in the pasture, swinging (and unfortunately missing) at the lumbering orc menace. However, Talib found that his aim with his [spectral weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon) spell was on-track and deadly. Manny took the the orcs with his bracer of of blades and his devastating dagger work. Meanwhile, Gunmetal found his new bow, a gift from Daerin Stonebottom, a little more tricky than it was in practice and Doggo had an even worse time. A novelty, drawing the attention of the orcs, the mechanical canine was knocked down, quickly trussed and thrown into the wagon!

Their numbers dwindling quickly, three orcs planned to make a hasty retreat with their robotic prize. But Grosh, as expected, had been excelling in the melee and saw the wagon about to depart. Fearlessly, the mighty minotaur clad in his gorgeous plate armor, lowered his head and charged across the field. Grosh hit the wagon square with a horn and his broad, armored shoulder. He tore into the back of the wagon, crushing the left-rear wheel and the cargo bed above it. Saved, of a sort, but still bound, Doggo flopped unceremoniously to the turf!

Gunmetal, Grosh and company made quick work of the remaining orcs, intentionally allowing two of them to flee. They waited briefly and then instructed Doggo to give pursuit with the instructions to return when the orcs made camp and not to get caught! While they were inspecting the very minimal damage that the orcs were able to do to the hamlet, Doggo returned. It had only been gone for a couple hours. Gunmetal reported that the orcs had stopped for a break and then bolted straight for Doggo! Fortunately, it had enough time to realize what was happening and enough distance between them to turn (*mechanical*) tail and run!

With fresh, very clear tracks to follow, in the winter grass, the team consulted with the council of Tyr's Burden and let them know their plan to give pursuit. They outfitted the wagon and stock that they had been given by the town for the mission and Gunmetal quickly repaired the smashed wagon the orcs had left behind. With the two wagons ready to go, they team head off into the morning light.

They traveled for about a day, trading off resting and guiding the wagons, with Doggo out front following the orc's trail. Even over a day old, the trail was fairly easy to follow in the tall grass. The orcs initially headed out east, but turned sharply north, *ducking behind* the low hills skirting Tyr's Burden. 

The trail abruptly ended at a large patch of grass that was mysteriously darker than the rest of grass leasing up to it. Talib dropped a shower of [sacred flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sacred-flame) which appeared to dance along the surface of the grass and then extinguish as if the surface were damp. It did look darker, but did not look *exactly* damp. Manny stabbed at the grass and reported that it felt soft, almost spongy and found that it was difficult to pull his weapon out. Grosh, noticed that the darker grass appeared to sit on top of the lighter grass, and probed between with one of the orc's disgarded javelins. It went about a foot and then stopped, he pushed the javelin further into the flora. Gorsh and Manny used the javelin like a lever and tried to move the mysterious grass, to no avail.

It didn't take lone for Force Grey to realize that while the orc's tracks stopped at the edge of the darker surface, they continued on the other side. Deciding, whatever the dark grass was, had to be a mystery for another day, they continued to follow the orcs tracks...
