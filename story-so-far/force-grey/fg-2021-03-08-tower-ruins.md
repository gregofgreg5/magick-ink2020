## The Ruins and the Skeleton (March 8, 2021)

And...
It wasn't until Force Grey began to walk around the other side of the ruins that they found the giant skeleton. More accurately, the petrified skeleton embedded in the hillside. Huge and, a bit terrifying, the skeleton loomed over the small entrance to a cavern.

The investigation of the skeleton and the tower ruins continued. A more close investigation of the remains led to an estimate that standing, the creature would have been about 27-30 feet tall. There were obvious injuries and there was no markings or carvings on the bones. From what they could tell, the creature had fallen there, and the hillside had continued to grow around it. More dirt fell on it, more moss, more grass. It looked like had been there for a very, very long time. From the remains, none of the agents could tell whether it was some kind of gigantic humanoid or an actual giant of some kind.

In stark contrast to the rest of the campground, the area around the cave entrance was clean. Spotless even. There was no refuge, no carcasses, no sign that the orcs ever went near the cavern. Tracks of the orcs were all around the campsite, but nothing near the cavern or skeleton. As if they didn't know it was there, or avoided it. It was as if the orcs had never even entered the cavern. In the dust and dirt, they could make out a set of footprints that led from the mouth to the back of the cave, to the door. Manny investigated them and determined that he was certain that they were humanoid, probably of average build, but the stride was twice as long as one might expect. And it appeared that the footfalls landed with a heavy weight. They appeared to live right up to the door.

Beside the skeleton was what appeared to be the mouth of a cave. 

The cave inside was about 80 long and 45 feet across. It was dark and cold, as things like this go, more so than they might effect. And remarkably clean, except for some cobwebs, no sign of scat or any other things that might live in a cave like this. No sign of anything at all, other than a large door on the east side of the wall. There was a strange, alluring humming sound coming from the cave. It was both haunting and *the only way to describe it would be **enticing***. Gunmetal suggested that it sounded like it had some kind of rhythm, like some kind of machine.

The door stood, about 9 feet tall and about 10 feet across. The door was remarkable for three reasons:
1. The inscription in the door, carved in an ancient form of under-common with gold highlights:

2. The door had no handle.
3. The door had no hinges. The wood was beautiful and looked both ancient and brand new. In the center of the door on the left, there were nine lines in two columns, carved in what appeared to be duergar.

The team recognized *Malbolge* as one of the rings of hell. There was a *Storm Reach* where Gunmetal was from, but *that can't be right*... *for reasons...* They speculated that alpha-numeric column might be a date or year marker. Especially since they, themselves, were from *Waterdeep at the end of 1492*. 

While the others inspected the door, Grosh went back to the ruins to see if there were any markings or anything in the ruins that were similar to the markings on the door.

Manny attempted to use one of his daggers to push between the frame and the door, to no avail. The blade sunk into the crevice a bit but stopped cold, up and down the door. Grosh, returned without finding anything of note in the ruins, and tried to peer between any of cracks and crevices, but there was nothing else to be seen. Gunmetal stepped up and and cast [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) on the door and was able to detect a powerful spell or spells, on the door. As he leaned back to get a better look at the door, he noticed a panel had appeared beneath the carved letters.

Manny tried to put his dagger into the tiny seam of the panel, to no avail. Gunmetal tried to push it open, and it moved ever so slightly. The mighty Grosh stepped up and pushed it with all his might, moving it up and down and left and right. Suddenly it slid open.

>Worlds connected 
by a river of stars
kingdoms separated 
by rivers of fools
Time, a river 
that stretches 
behind footfalls 
and ahead of dreams
whose every journey,
begins in the heartland

Gunmetal investigated the strange, colorful mechanism. He ran his fingers over the flowers, only after he had pricked his finger did he notice the very sharp points on the tips of each petal and a stinger in the middle. A bright bead of blood welled up on his fingertip, but dissipated quickly enough he hardly paid it any notice. The others watched carefully, Talib checking to ssee if there was any change in the gnome's demeanor, in case he was poisoned.

Undeterred, Gunmetal looked carefully at the sphere at the top of the lock. A four-inch sphere that appears to have some kind of cloudy substance inside, a dark red substance moved slowly inside. He touched it cautiously, unaware that the blood on his finger had returned. For a second he felt the blood pulled from his finger. It dripped down into the sphere and the turmoil inside became even an even more dark red-purple. It turned and spun and then the door disappeared. In it's place Gunmetal sawa portal that looked similar to the one that they had traveled through back in Waterdeep. On the other side was a frozen room that he couldn't quite make out through a layer of ice and frost. And in the back of his mind he heard:

![](https://i.imgur.com/W4HRy0I.jpg)

>Prick your finger
Open the gate
Do not linger
choose your fate
>
>Your contract sealed
and journey begun
destiny to be revealed
across the mighty river
run

Without hesitation, Gunmetal thought *Waterdeep 1492* and stepped through the portal. As the world spun around him, he could feel himself being transported. His last thought on this plane was *Oh shit, Doggo...*

What the others saw was Gunmetal touching the sphere. Manny noticed a trickle of blood coming out of Grey's finger. Grosh noticed that the sphere had grown darker, more angry. And Talib stood silently as the gnome just vanished.

Manny and Talib turned and looked at Grosh and then back at the door, a bit surprised that he wasn't the one to vanish. Or be disintegrated... but somehow, after all that they had been through and seen, they didn't think he was destroyed.

For one, there were no remains. Which isn't a perfect conclusion to draw, but had some merit.

They debated going back Tyr's Burden. After all Talib still had Fazzanach's staff, which they had promised to return. Manny was all for going back and reconnoitering. There was a part of him who wanted nothing more than to go back to Horace Harper and compare notes about their findings. Though, he suspected that no one from the sleepy hamlet would know anything.

Manny and Talib debated the meaning of the bad poem. They suspected that it referenced some kind of *time travel*: "Time, a river
that stretches behind footfalls and ahead of dreams"

Manny thought maybe the blood of the individuals was important to the *heartland* or home of someone using the door. Talib, his studies of medicine and divinity, suggested that the heart was also the center of the blood in one's body.

They all wondered whether the different flowers would have a different effect.

Meanwhile, Grosh took matters into his own hand and pricked his finger on the same purple flower and then touched the sphere. And in an instance he was also gone.

With a shrug and a sigh, Talib and Manny looked at each other. Neither committed entirely to meeting the fate of their comrades. They retrieved one of the dead orc raiders and Talib put its fingers to one of the flowers and then on the sphere. The blood rolled down the sphere, but nothing happened. Manny solemnly pointed out that it wasn't too bad here, *Tyr's Burden*, that they had it pretty nice. Talib nodded, understanding and with almost a vague look of regret on his face, he reached over and stuck his finger firmly on to the sharp edges of the purple flower. A second after he touched the sphere, he was gone too.

Manny looked back at the mouth of the cave. What did he owe these guys? *Force Grey*, the special arm, the *surgical tool* of the City Watch. The same Watch that... *well that's another story*. Besides, *misfits*, the three of them were misfits, barely fit in anywhere, but they had shared some ground. *What of it, he'd shared a lot of ground with a lot of folk. Some good, some...* But these guys were good. He, maybe, even liked them, a little. And *Force Grey*. It wasn't the Watch or the Guard, it was something else. And they didn't just *take anyone*, And he had promises to keep. His resolve hardening, he turned and looked at the mouth of the cavern one more time and then pricked his finger on the purple flower.

Swearing and cursing all three of his companions, he vanished. 
Gone. All of them, the cave empty again, except for...

### If the *River of Time* were a room
![](https://i.imgur.com/SHI1PVf.jpg)


They all appeared in the small alcove in front of a stone wall. In the wall, inset, like the wooden door in the cavern was *what appeared to be a stone door*. A plain stone slab, with no discernable markings. 

At their feet, a small stream of water ran ***up the stairs*** towards them and into the base of the wall/door behind them.

In front of them was a large room full of *water*, with stone platforms floating on the surface. On the other side of the room was another set of stairs leading out of the water, to another door.

To either side of them there were two dry pools. At the either end of the dry pools was a four and a half foot statue of a cat of some sort, in the center of another, smaller stone circle. On one side, the statue was severely damaged with parts of the statue all around the stone base. On the other side the statue was in pristine shape, completely unblemished, at it's feet a very small amount of *water*.

Inspecting it more carefully, Gunmetal, now without his trusted robot companion, determined that the broken material around the statue was indeed part of the statue. And peering down the steps, he believed that it was only a shallow pool.

At first they were careful not to touch the water. But that too bore inspection. Manny threw a dagger at one of the platforms. It crashed off an careened into the air and vanished. As they would ordinarily. Gunmetal, determined to see what would happen if a weapon hit the water threw his infused handaxe at one of the platforms. It bounced off and fell into the water. He *recalled* the axe and it flew straight to his hand.

Grosh dropped an arrow into the stream at his feet. It appeared unharmed. Talib dropped a bolt into the stream and it floated, eventually, to the wall at the back of the alcove.

While the others inspected the strange *water*, viscous and creepy, Grosh sized up the platforms. About three and a half feet on each side, they all seemed to move a few inches from side to side, to and fro. And then, without warning he leapt to the nearest platform.

It seemed sturdy. Holding steady even his enormous weight. 

Manny, also now sizing up the platforms, thought maybe he ccould pull one over. Gunmetall suggested that if they could get a bunch them he could fashion... *a bridge*...? But instead of trying to lasso one of the platforms, he created a large loop and threw it to Grosh.

Grosh almost lost his *footing* when he looked down to attach the rope. While Gunmetal thought the pool was shallow, from where he stood, Grosh could see no bottom! He quickly, carefully attached the rope and then leapt 7to the next platform. And that's when the trouble began.

While Manny and company were unsuccessfully trying to dislodge the platform, Grosh discovered a new problem. Suddenly he found himself confronted by *Talib*, standing on the water, reading to attack him. Grosh looked back at the rest of his team. Manny was still here. *And here too*. His battle-honed skills ready, he struck first at the dopleganger, but missed. *Talib*  swung his flaming mace at the minotaur, but also missed.

Manny seeing something amiss on Grosh's platform, jumped over to one as well. Suddenly, beside him *Gunmetal Grey* was standing **on the water** next to him. A quick double-take and he saw that the real Gunmetal was still on the side of the pool, sizing up the jump to a platform. They scuffled daggers slicing through the air, *Gunmetal* drew first blood.

From the edge of the pool, the rest of Force Grey saw their companions, on their own, doing some kind of macabre dance. From solid ground, they couldn't see the *imposters*.

Talib leaped to the last platform. *Manny* appeared beside him. Steel flashed and a battle of daggers began.

Grosh and *Talib* continued their battle, this time, for the first time, *Talib* landed a blow with his mace and used it's mighty force to send Grosh into the *water*. Sinking, a bit, in his magical armor, Grosh willed himself back to the surface.

Still unsure of what was going on, but seeing an open platform, Gunmetal leaped to into the stone plate, only to find *Grosh* standing in front of him.

Seeing Grosh in peril, Manny tied one end of his rope to a weapon and dropped into the pool for Grosh and then bolted past for the other side of the pool, the rope trailing behind him. A veritable life-line for the minotaur. Manny ran and jumped, *Talib* and *Gunmetal* chasing after him.

*to be continued 3/24.*
