# Murder on Thyrgarr Station

For more information: [Thyrgarr Station Background](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/story-so-far/force-grey/2021-04-05-thyrgarr-station-background.md#thyrgarr-station-background).

## Lodging
After the team *leased* their souls *for two years*, following their death, they were shown to their staterooms. Each member receives their own room, that *only they* can access from the hub. Because they were lodged as a *group* they can use the interconnecting portals in the lodging area to access one anther's door. The staterooms were probably the best, most luxurious rooms that any of these members of Force Grey had ever stayed in. Travelers can be expected to stay as long as a month waiting for their ship to arrive and Thyrgarr Station wants their guests to be content, peaceful and most of all comfortable out of the common areas.

Everyone took the time to recover and *find their bearings* as much as they could. After, Manny and Gunmetal made their way to the Hub, where they had their own little agendas. Neither Talib nor Grosh were seen leaving their rooms, presumably hunkered down for the night.

Before checking out the Hub, Manny wanted to get a look at the Atrium, scouting out places to *people watch* in this very, very strange new environment.

## The Hub
The Hub was by far the busiest part of the station. Where the lobby had maybe a couple of dozen people, there were easily 40-50 people/creatures in the Hub. Most of them were just milling about or gathered around the few tables, the rest were either in or waiting to get into one of the five merchant *kiosks*.

### Merchant Kiosks
One of the true wonders of a Thruspace station was their *Merchant Bazaar* or *Merchant Kiosks*. From these small, almost closet-like boxes, travellers could literally step out of the station and into a shop. The shops could be physically located on any *plane of existence* or *timeline* that the traveller had encountered, as that information was *coded* into their physical body.

The shops were accessible from a menu that floated beside the kiosk. A stone tablet, similar to all the others that they had seen in the station, the writing appeared to be carved into the stone, but also changed frequently: alternating between various languages. For *75 gold pieces* (a sale for *first time travelers*, it was usually 200) a traveler could choose a location on the menu and effortlesly step into another world.

The shops offered a huge variety of goods and services. Even fantastic shops filled with magic and wonderful trinkets and weapons could be accessed. Only food and drinks were unavailable, as the station typically preferred the be able control access to those through the refreshment boxes and the Dinning area.

A traveler could purchase up to one hour before their access pass expired and they re-appeared in the Hub. Items and merchandise of all sorts, could be purchased and brought back and of course other items, like payment, could be left behind. Otherwise, the traveler came back with whatever was on their person or in their hands.

Gunmetal perused the menu and to his surprise found not only the *kind of shop* that he was looking for, but actually found a shop that he knew. A legendary artificer shop from his homeland. For Gunmetal, an hour almost wasn't enough. While he had a particular idea in mind, it was a joy to browse this fantastic shop again. In the end, Gunmetal left with a huge box of materials: a basic kit of some kind and a whole bunch of accessories and specific parts that he thought he might need for the design of *Doggo 2.0*. Anxious to start, Gunmetal first had to draw-up and design the construct, based on the parts that he was able to acquire. And then, because of the complex and unusal design, he estimated that the actual building of Doggo would have to wait, since it might take him a day or two to actually complete. Happy, he dragged his treasure back to his cabin to begin work.

Manny also had a particuar item in mind. He dialed up a clothier who specialized in leather work. Another wonderful shop, legendary in it's own right, ***Krickel's*** was located in [Bezantur](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bezantur), in the nation of [Thay](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thay). Specializing *active* wear, the shop catered to wizards, sorcerers and their retainers. The tailors and leather workers at Krickel's specialized in fashion, functionality and protection. At first, Manny didn't find what he was looking for among the fashion and moderate protective gear offered in the shop. But after striking up a conversation with one of the clerks, he took Manny back to a more clandestine part of the shop, where they kept more *exotic* and definitely more *functional* garments. The practical wares were separated here, less for concealment from prying eyes, but more to proffer the appearance of a more *upscale* boutique. In the backroom Manny found a treasure trove of leather armor and clothing accessories that would make any thief or assassin or spellcaster's heart race. *Functional* was indeed the theme, with garments and accessories built to hold spell components and materials or any number of weapons or vials. While at first he thought he might have to have something custom built, he was able to find the kind of torso harness that he was looking for, right on the rack. The clerk saw Manny inspecting the holsters and attachments and told him that if could come back in a week they could customize whatever he needed. *But he didn't really have a week or did he...* Politely, he declined, for the moment and purchased the harness and a concealing duster from the front of the shop. 

Manny left through the front door of the shop. When he walked into the kiosk he had appeared right on the inside of the front door, as if he had used the same entrance that walked out into the streets of Bezantur. When he went to leave, he followed his own steps and walked out through the door and stepped out of the *merchant kiosK* and back in to the Hub.

Intrigued by the concept of the *merchant kiosk* Manny went to the one *friendly source* of information that he had come across in the station, the Dispatcher Raahzz. The giant ogre slug was, again, happy to see him and when asked explained that the kiosks were gateways to *planar* and *temporal* places that were similar to the traveler's origin. But, answering his question directly, there was not consistency with the *when* of when a traveller might emerge in any particular shop. It isn't unheard of for someone to go through twice and end up at an earlier period of time than the first time they had gone through. So, while customizing a thing might be possible, special arrangements for delivery would have to be made. And *not every* destination was aware that they were a *stop* in the kiosk line. 

Manny thanked her and lamented that there wasn't a good ol' fashion pub or tavern to be found. Raahzz told him that *back in the day* that was possible, but nowadays, the station likes to keep a tighter reign on some of the services, *reduces the rowdy factor* she told. Seeing his disappointment, and genuinely liking him, she took him in her confidence and gave him a large black and silver coin. The coin was heavy and a little bit sinsister. She put a large *finger*... digit... towards her mouth and motioned for silence.
>Try this, it'll buy you an hour of peace.

And then she sent him on his way back to the kiosks. Manny waited his turn, occassionaly fumbling with the strange coin in his pocket, *sizing up* it's feel and weight, but not daring to pull it out to look at it, for fear that others might see it. He had gathered that it was some *big secret* and the last thing he wanted to do was wreck his chance at *this peace*.

### An unexpected cameo: Trollskull Manor

When his turn came, Manny inserted his coin into the spot for payment, which he realized now was designed to accept all sorts of coin or material. The coin dropped in and he watched as the *menu* on the tablet changed. He quickly glanced around to see if anyone noticed, but no one seemed to be paying any attention and indeed, what would they see? It was challenging to read the tablet up close and impossible from a distance. He looked through the list and found a name he recognized, in fact the only name he could read.

>*Trollskull, Waterdeep 1492*

He might have preferred a gateway to the *Yawning Portal* or even the less civiilzed *Skewered Dragon*, but this would do. Of course, he had heard that there were new owners and re-opening of the storied tavern and manor. He had also heard some rumblings about some shady connections with Xanthar's Guild or even the Zhentarim. He was sure that one day, he (or someone from Force Grey) would wind up there on business.

But today, it was the only game in town. So he selected and stepped through, into a the entry of a busy tavern. He was immediately greeted by a medium-ish sized troll. Large for a creature, but small for a troll and dressed like he was some kind of businessman, **Lubash** welcomed him.

Manny spent his hour in bliss, enjoying the camaraderie that is quickly becoming the hallmark of the tavern. From the friendly staff to the *giant white shadow* singing along with the bards, Manny had found his little slice of *home*, that ended far too quickly and abruptly.

## Red Alert
In the wee hours of the morning, before the station had begun to properly start it's business, an alarm sounded. A loud siren blasted all over the station, clearly a warning beacon. A phrase was repeated in at least five languages. In common:
>Alert. Alert. Station is in lockdown. Shelter in place until further notice.

They hadn't noticed before, but there were no obvious light sources in the room. No torches, the rooms were all somehow illuminated by magic. An illumination that shifted from the dark of evening to a bright red. Talib almost immediately left his quarters to check on the rest of Force Grey. After all, he knows the kind of trouble that they are likely to get into.

About two hours went by and the illumination in the stateroom shifted from red to a light orange. Another alarm sounded and announced that the station was still on alert, but the lockdown was lifted.

## Spryos & Ozaal of the Black Rose
Manny and Talib were about to out to the Dinning common. Gunmetal and Grosh decided to also join them. Manny stopped first at the Dispatcher's desk to check with Raahzz, to see if she wanted anything from Dinning. To his surprise, in her place was one of her duergar assistants. He wanted a sausage muffin. 

The Dinning area was crowded, but the team all noticed that the crowd in the station, in general was quieter. There seemed to be fewer people and more security. In the common areas, the lighting had shifted all the way back from red to daylight. Still, all five of the tables were full, except for just enough space for them at one table. Of course, sitting at the table were two very unsettling characters.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, Spyro began a conversation. The two groups of travelers began to *cautiously compare notes*.

The unarmored, *maybe less threatening* of the two introduced himself as *Spyros* and his larger companion as *Ozaal*. He said that they were representatives of the... *Black Rose **Social** Club* and that they were *ambassadors*, of a sort.

Clearly, both were combatants, they both had an unmistakable menace about them. Spyros, moved with grace and an almost unimaginable speed. While Ozaal seemed to be more awkward but still somehow precise in his motion.

Like Force Grey, Spyros said that this was their first time through Thyrgarr Station and knew little more than they did about what was going on or what the protocols were.

Before they got much more information out of each other, another security agent rushed in and began talking to a group of guards. Abruptly they all started heading towards the Lobby.

The travelers glanced at each other and made pleasant excuses for both groups to leave. Sypros and Ozaal rose and strode purposefully towards the Lobby. Before Force Grey followed them out, Talib let the team know that both of them were undead.

## The murder
Manny took the group back to Raahzz's desk, where the Dispatcher had returned. After a moment, Raahzz confided in Manny that the station's Senior Superintendent Hycks had been murdered. When they asked if that was the alert, she gave them an even juicier bit of non-public information: last night one of the station seers identified an unexpected incoming vessel or vessels. *Unexpected* is never good in Thruspace, she explained. All travel along the thruway is tightly controled and regulated.
>What we really need is an investigator.

She joked. The team looked nervously at Manny, who confessed that they were indeed *investigators*. She was shocked, she had Manny pegged more as one who ran from the law, not did the chasing. But there they were. After a minute she led the team back to the Administrator's office where they had previously signed away their souls... *for two years*.

Hycks was indeed dead, lying in a pool of his own blood, mostly around his neck and head. His body was in front of his desk. Behind the desk, Deputy Station Managers Gruntharaax and Yr’ylleh were arguing fiercely.

Stuck in a stalemate, after a *brief* discussion, the two agreed to allow Force Grey to help.

## Clues from the crime scene
Here's what they learned from their first look in the office.
* Hycks was killed by a single, powerful blow that apparently knocked him back against the desk before he fell to the ground.
* The wound appeared to be casued by a very sharp blade, the cut went almost from ear to pointy ear.
* The wound was getting worse, necotric damage was festering at the edge of the cut.
* Gruntharaxx was in command over two hundred *troops*. He was adamant that his force could repel any attack.
* His security force was more of a blunt instrument, their involvement almost always ended in swift corporeal punishment, regardless of infraction. *Investigation* was not really their mandate.
* The station itself has *emergency powers* that can only be activated by the station Superintendent. The powers of the Superintendent passes to one of his deputies. Typically there would be a succession plan or at least an agreement for this kind of situation. Of course, in this case, there was not.
* Yr’ylleh, the station's *chief administrator* insisted that the only way to ward off the impending *invasion* was the station's emergency powers. And that Gruntharaax should yield command to him to weild it. 
* It wasn't spoken, but the *emergency powers* were some kind of great magic, which was clearly more Yr’ylleh's strengths than Gruntharaax.
* For his part, Gruntaraax did not want control of the station, rather he was confident that his troop could hold off any invasion, at least long enough for the Thyrgarr Thruspace Engineers to send reinforcement and *a proper commander*.
* There is clearly no love loss between Gruntharaax and Yr’ylleh. Yr’ylleh has no use for brute force and Gruntharaax doesn't trust the mindflayer one bit.
* When they asked Raahzz about Spyros and Ozaal, she told them that they were indeed *some kind of ambassadors* from the Barony of the Black Rose. And that if there were anyone daring and brave enough to pull off this kind of act, she wouldn't put it past them.
* She told them that it was true that Spryos and Ozaal had never been on the station before, but Drakko and the *giant* that he travels with had been a number times. She always thought that they were doing some kind of *recruiting*.
* Drakko, was a particularly dangerous hobgoblin and Raahzz thought that he was probably as good of a suspect as anyone.

## Epilogue
After discussing with Raahzz and her two duergar associates (Thimm & Gnayte), plan was hatched. Raahzz would send Thimm to distract Drakko and draw him out of his room. Gnayte would use his station control access to get them into the hobgoblin's room to search it for clues. But she would need a little time to set this all up. In the meantime, Force Grey decided to spend some time in the Hub.

They had just started finding positions around the Hub to get a good feel for the room, when a figure hurried toward Manny and Talib. He brushed past Gunmetal and greeted them.
>It's about time! Where have you guys been? I need your help!

To everyone's surprise, **Eskander Bahrami**, the merchant that they had *rescued* (and Manny threw through the portal into this time period), had found them. He opened his cloak revealing a sinister looking black blade dangling from a shoulder strap. Just looking at it there was no way to tell it was a necrotic blade. But the blood on the edge of the sword was not a good sign.
