# History of the Station
>Thyrgrarr Station has been owned and operated by  Thyrgarr Thruspace Engineers, LLC. for almost two thousand consecutive planar years. Serving as your *prime material* connection to the Astral Thruway.
>
>***From here you can go anywhere*** has been the motto of this humble *can do* little station. 

Thygarr was a storm giant whose tribe once dominated this area in at least three prime material planes. He forged an alliance with various creatures on the different planes and was the architect of this station. His quest to retrieve the powerful artifact that would allow the station to connect to the Astral Thruway is legendary. On *this plane*, he primarily worked with duergar, drow and gith. He and his people died out 500 years before Blackcloak's purge of Undermountain. It is Thygarr's skeleton outside the cavern. Or at least that's the legend.

Knowledge of the station was passed on through both drow and duergar legend and over the centuries these dark races have used this area and a few have even used the station. 

While Thygarr Station is off of the main line of the thruway, it still connects to vastness of *everything*. The *arteries* that connect with Thygrarr are lesser, often less reputable stations, many fallen under disrepair. In fact, it's clientele tend to be of the *evil* persuasion. Not unlike Thygarr itself.

# Station Personnel
## Senior Station Superintendent Hycks
A drow, many people believe that Hycks is descendant of the dark elves who helped establish Thyrgarr Station on this plane, although no one really knows for sure and he has never confirmed nor denied his lineage.

Hycks has been a presence in Thyrgarr Station for over two hundred years. He worked in various roles throughout the station, including posts in security and a long stint as Deputy Station Master. His quiet and pleasant demeanor barely conceals a fierce and deadly set of skills.

A private man, with seeming little interests outside of his work, like most employees, he lived in a stateroom on the station. 

## Deputy Station Manager Yr'ylleh
Yr'ylleh, a mindflayer, has worked in the Astral Thruspace for over 75 years. He is a *regular company man* who has climbed the ranks in about half a dozen different enterprises, before settling in with the Thyrgarr Thruspace Engineers, LLC. about 15 years ago. He has a reputation throughout Thruspace as being a particularly efficient and effective administrator.

He is considered a *consummate administrator*, a true bureaucrat at heart. Many see him as a creature of rules and a bastion or order. Ever guarded, he has always hidden his true self beneath his professional faÃ§ade.

On the surface, he appears as ice cold as any Illithid, but deep down a fiery passion burns.


## Deputy Station Manager Grunthraxx
Gruntharaax seems like a rarity among his kind. His intelligence is staggering for a barlgura. Known throughout the lower hells as much for their brutality as their dim wit, barlgura are considered experts at guerilla warfare and excellent scouts. Gruntharaxx, however is no ordinary barlgura. The story goes, Gruntharaax had been part of a scout unit that had been sent through one of the portals before Thyrgarr station was established. He had been *lost*, trapped in-between portals for centuries before one day he emerged from the *time pool* with a sheer cunning and intellect. 

Gruntharaxx has worked on the station for almost 30 years. He started as a member of station security and worked his way up to Deputy Station Master. He is also has developed connections to any number of cartels and criminal organizations throughout the thruway.

As the Deputy Station Master he is regarded as fierce and inflexible. While only Hycks and Yr'ylleh for sure, it is believed that Gruntharaxx employs about two hundred security guards of dozens and dozens of races.

## Dispatcher Raahzz
Raahzz is an ogre slug. A dedicated and hard-working employee of Thyrgarr Thruspace for as long as she can remember, she worked temp job after temp job until she started working dispatch. She worked dispatch for two other stations before coming to this one. 

In the center of the lobby, many frequent travelers and members of administration view her as the actual center of the station. Gruff and, at the same time friendly, she remembers the name of everyone she meets and *something about them*. Sometimes it's even something that's true.

# Around the Station

## The Lobby
Just about everyone enters from the lobby. Even though there are many portals to various realms accessible in the station, special magicks prevent *new* arrivals from any of the other portals on the station. In the center of the circular room the *Dispatcher's Information Desk*. On both sides of the desk are large, 12x4, black tablet/obelisques of unidentifiable material. They are jet black and appear to be smooth like glass and give off no radiant heat. There are carvings on the obelisques that appear in two columns. Despite being carved into the tablets, the characters appear to change frequently. 

Visitors are always urged to approach the information desk, whether by Raahzz, who is almost always at her post or station security, if someone is found wandering around the lobby without clear purpose. At the kiosk guests are scanned, identified and sorted to their destinations.

There are five visible exits from the lobby. Two of them lead *lodging* areas, one leads to the Dinning Hall, one leads to the Hub and the other leads to Administration.

## Dinning Hall
The dinning hall is a narrow (15' x 30') room with five large tables. There is a an *order window*/ french door that leads to the kitchen where travelers place their orders and collect their food. Unlike other areas of the station, there is limited to no variety in Hacx's (the cook) kitchen. He does tend to try to have a small sampling from different tastes, but it's not like other parts of the station where you might be able to choose something specifically from home or your preferred delicacy. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit.

There are always at least three of Grunthraxx's security detail here, usually a Gith or a Drow, seldom any of the more exotic or disturbing creatures that might be off-putting to some dinners. *As if the Gith were easy to look at*. Grunthraxx's men tolerate even less *misbehavior* in the Dinning Hall than they would anywhere else in the station, which is to say punishment for causing a ruckus here is severe. 

The food here is actually pretty good and it is always a good value. The station under-prices it's food services, in order to make sure none of the travelers are just *hangry*.

## The Hub
The Hub is the activity heart of the Station. There are usually dozens and dozens of travelers and security in the Hub.

There are three *refreshment* posts, where a traveler can purchase beverages of their choice from what appears to be some kind of magical conjuring box. 

### Merchant stations
>There are five *booths* that are planar passages that lead to various shops along the continuum of the person entering it. Where with the right direction and for the right fee, a shopper can *dial-up* just about any kind of merchant they can imagine. The only catch is that they can only call-up and enter shops that are similar *planes* or *lines* of existence for which they have been *marked*, or have already encountered. 
>
>Each *booth* can access one location at a time. Like the station itself there are protections against exiting any of the merchant shops to anywhere other than back into the station as well. In other words, you might be able to go to Xoblob's shop in Waterdeep (circa 1492) but you wouldn't be able to walk out into Waterdeep. *Do with that what you will*.
>
>It costs 200 gold pieces (or the *local equivalent*) to access a kiosk for one hour. After an hour the user is *kicked out* and would find themselves in front of the kiosk with whatever was purchased.

While there are no tables or chairs in the Hub, there are small standing tables randomly located around the room. These tables are really only large enough for 3-4 people to huddle around them comfortably.

As you might expect, Grunthraxx's security forces patrol the Hub in great numbers and with the most diverse selection of their troop. The most frightening and dangerous *secrurity force members* are always stationed in the Hub. 

There are eight entrances in and out of the Hub. One  leads to the Lobby and one to the Atrium. The other six doors lead to station lodging suites. There is a door. The doors to the Lobby are always open. The doors to the Atrium will open for travelers whose ships are in-bound and will only allow *ticketed* passengers through the doorway. Access to the lodging suites is keyed to the specific traveler. In other words, from the Hub a traveler may only access the suite to which they have been assigned. They can bring others with them into their suite once the door is keyed, but no one else can key their door. Except for station personnel, of course.

## Lodging Suites
You wouldn't know it looking at any terrestrial map, but Thyrgarr station houses over two hundred lodging suites, which range from the most modest 8'x8' quarters to luxurious suites, some that even have environmental features like pools of lava or water. Naturally, a traveler's suite is directly related to what they have paid for their lodging, as well as what was available. Suites designated for specific *planar* or *linear* accommodations to make the traveler feel more at home. Similar to the shops in the market, travelers can typically only access suites that are located on the same (*or similar*) plane or *line of existence*. 

In this regard, The Thyrgarr Thruway Engineers have an arrangement with a number of different stations along the Thruway and they connect to their stations via the *Thurway Interplanar Portal* system. Typically these staterooms exist in small pockets between planes, and are maintained to the standard of the timeline or *other planar locale*. As such, the staterooms are only connected directly to Thygarr station, but are *atmospherically maintained off-site*, as it were.

Most staterooms (except the very smallest) can also access the interconnected *hallways* which can be used to access other staterooms on the same (*or similar*) plane or *line of existence*. For security purposes, travelers can only access other rooms to which they have been previously associated with, or have the *magic phrase* to access them. In other words, these passage ways are designed for parties traveling together or meeting up with others that they have given their code phrases to allow access.
It is possible, though *at one's own risk* to gain access to disparate *planar or linear* suites from the hallways, with the appropriate *code phrases*.

For the most part, the lodging suites are not patrolled by Grunthraxx's *men*. However they do occasionally patrol the hallways and can be hired to to guard entrances.


## The Atrium
The Atrium is the waiting area for travelers whose vessels are already in-bound to the station. Another circular room, the atrium is the most visually spectacular areas of the station. The doomed ceiling is completely *transparent* and looks out to some of the most amazing views that can be imagined. As only one astral ship can dock or launch at once, the sky above the atrium reflects that of *wherever* the incoming vessel had been coming from, in breathtaking fashion.

Aside from the view, there room is filled with benches for travelers to wait for their vessel. There are also four other notable features in the room. There is an angled observation path that extends from the floor on both sides of the room and rises towards the ceiling, to about 30 feet at it's highest point. There are two alcoves that have a large (2' round) sphere that float above a three-foot pedestal. These spheres are used to scry out to incoming vessels, to see their progress and are available to purchase direct communication to passengers and crew aboard the vessels. Finally, there is a staircase that leads up to the entry to the docking plank.

The stairwell is rigged. It can be completely released into thruspace. The door to the docking platform can only be opened by station personnel. Typically, once a ship arrives, the door is opened and passengers are allowed to proceed to the docking area.

There are always 5-6 of Grunthraxx's security agents in the Atrium. There isn't usually any trouble in the Atrium, but like the Dinning Room, the guards here keep a tight reign on any shenanigans.

## The Dock
![image](https://i.imgur.com/GliqyXL.jpg)

The Atrium staircase enters into a room that looks like it could be the altar at an ancient temple. The floor and walls are made of some dark brown stone or other hard, unidentifiable mineral. In the center of the *altar* is a 10 round sphere that floats about a foot above an open pit that appears to stretch into an endless darkness below. As ticketed passengers must walk into the sphere in order to gain entrance to the docking area.

Travelers who have not made the requisite blood sacrifice to enter the sphere, they will fall into the endless pit.

From the open dock, travelers can go back through the doorway, which opens directly to the floating sphere. 

The sphere is the both the entry to the dock and the station's beacon, which allows astral vessels to locate it.

There are two landing platforms that are operational and one that has fallen into almost complete disrepair following an *extremely rare* docking mishap. One of the functioning docks is also badly damaged but still serves for smaller vessels. Grunthraxx's security skiff is generally moored at this dock, and the platform is not accessible to travelers.

Grunthraxx's most feared officers rotate through the docks. There are typically a dozen or so on shift at any time. The guards will give one warning and then kill any one out of line. There is a warning sign that anyone caught brandishing or openly carrying a weapon or spell will be killed without question. Security takes that rule very seriously.

The dock itself is an open platform into the astral thruway. There is a powerful spell that protects the dock from the chaos of the astral thruway. The *thruway*, not being part of any particular plane and in it's own way connected to them all, is wild and almost entirely unpredictable. Only powerful magic makes astral travel and the permanence of the stations possible.
