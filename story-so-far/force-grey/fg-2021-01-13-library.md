## Episode Three: "Smeagol" is spelled with an "O"- January 13, 2021

### The Library Portals

Carefully the party moved on to the next room, with robbo-doggo in the lead. The room is a library with two rows of shelves full of books in the middle of the room and books lining the walls. Inside the library the doggo found two portals, one hole in the ground, supported by a ledge of huge stones. A brisk cold breeze is pushed out of the hole, inside of it a whirl of snow can be seen in the make-shift well. Around the stone ledge are a few bundles of weapons and a couple of shields. All of which are covered in a sheet of ice.

Towards the back of the library, even from the entry of the room, they could make out the second portal. It hung in the air, a circular portal that stood about 12-feet tall. Framed by a circle of ice, with strange (kobold) ruins carved into the ice.

Guarding and operating these portals they discovered two more ice kobolds, two ice mephits and *Edel'llz* an ice kobold sorceror, who appeared to be in charge of this enitre frozen fiasco. Things such as they are, melee broke out. **Grosh** (who you may know as *Gordon*) was once again the star of the battle, beginning with a devastating dash and strike from his mighty axe to a thundering charge that took down two sets of bookcases and crashed into Edel'llz. Doggo also put up a good fight, while it seemed like the rest of the world was *hellbent* on knocking it into the ice portal. Grey, while not a big reader, found that the books around the room made excellent fodder for his [catapult](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/catapult) spell. So much so that he exhausted his spell energies! Manny and his shortbow and Talib Beni-Asmodai did their best to wrest control of the room from the kobolds and to keep their *new associates* Ashani and Eskander in line. 

Unfortunately, as soon as she saw the portal floating in the back of the room, Ashani made a break for it. Talib, who had been near the portal, but not close enough to stop her watched as she jumped through, all *Guardian on the Edge of Forever style*. He reported that she leaped through and appeared, *what looked like* about 10-15 feet in the distance and kept on running.

Talib saw that on the other side of the portal was a more rural area, no city roads and the only structures he could make out were in the distance and were much smaller than the large villas that surround Cavalier Villa outside. Wherever he was looking, wherever Ahsani had escaped to, was different. Even the weather, it was clearly no longer winter.

Meanwhile, Manny made sure that Eskander didn't also escape into the mysterious portal.

Drawn back into the battle, the kobolds and ice mephits were easily dispatched. Edel'llz was a different story, but despite his best efforts, he too was apprehended. Captured, not killed, the ice kobold sorcerer was interrogated.

Intertwined in his many threats, Edel'llz mocked the team that they were too late! **Fleagal** a devil and her army from **Stygia**, one of the levels of Hell, had already breached the portal and escaped into Waterdeep. 

>"Your *City of Splendors* will fall into a frozen ruin! The icy grip of Fleagal and a legion of her warriors have already breached your *precious crown*!"

It was clear that Edel'llz believed that the portal opened to Waterdeep. Talib knows many things and of the things that he is certain, wherever that portal opened up to, it was not where they were before they entered this cursed villa.

The second portal, Edel'llz told them was a passage to Stygia, the ice hell, where Fleagal reigned over legions of kobolds and frost giants alike. From what they gleaned from the sorcerer's ramblings, the devil has already taken an army, presumably kobolds through into *Waterdeep*

More utilitarian and less ornate than the floating portal, the portal to Stygia had some gear packs that had just been starting to get hauled up by the kobolds. About six feet across, the portal definitely did not look wide enough for a frost giant to cross through.

As they inspected it and tried to come up with a way to block the portal, they noticed that they were beginning to see a floor in the pit. Where, at first, it seemed like a bottomless drop, a stone floor seemed to be rising. Before long the portal was sealed.

The cautious type, the party barricaded the portal with bookcases and a couch to be safe.

The question remained then, follow Fleagal through the portal to *Waterdeep* or continue on the mission to rescue the nobles and figure out what is happening in the villa. It was decided that they portal would still be here afterwards and that the mission was at hand. It was decided that the party would move on through the rest of the villa, to try to unravel the mystery. 

As the party moved through the parlor, Manny dispatched Edel'llz. One less evil bastard to keep an eye or to keep out of trouble. Leaving them with only Eskander to keep an eye on.

The large central room remained engulfed in flames. Grosh thought there was something *off* about the flames. He even briefly considered that they might not be real, Sure enough the heat seemed real. And as before, it seemed even hotter than it had any right to be.

There were still three doors in the room. The door to the library, the door the foyer, which we all assume still opens, right?, and one door on the far wall, by the fireplace. Ironically while the fire seemed to be spreading rampantly through the room, there was still no fire in the fireplace. In fact, as the team inspected the only door they hadn't opened, they noticed how around this side of the room the heat was more bearable. As if the flames were much, much further away than they actually are. Again, raising Grosh's suspicions. *Not enough to charge into the fire mind you*.

On the other side of the door was pitched blackness. Even those with enhanced vision couldn't make out more than a foot or two around them, not even doggo. Manny lit his lantern, Grosh lit a torch and Gunmetal tinkered with a rod to produce a magical light, that on most occasions would illuminate a large circle around him. But like other magical means, the light was quelched. 

Undeterred, the party moved into the darkness to find themselves in a cavern of sorts. Where they had expected a constructed floor and walls, they found rock walls around them and a moist, dirt. The cavern proceeded in a slight incline, maybe two percent, leading deeper into the darkness. As they moved onward, a damp stench grew worse. Vegetation, water, rot, and other offensive smells permeated the dark passage. Finally, they emerged, pushing through a dense fog and to their surprise, some foliage, they emerged,... in a swamp.


To be continued **January 27**
