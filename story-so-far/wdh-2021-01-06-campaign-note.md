## The House of Inspired Hands

**02 Hammer 1493**

Borl returned just as the team was about to head to the docks to investigate the lead from the Office of the Harbor Master. He informed them that there is indeed at least one more of these *marionette's* at ***The House of Inspired Hands***.

The House of Inspired Hands is a temple of [Gond, the  Lord of All Smiths pushed for innovation and imaginativeness](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gond). At the House adepts and clerics alike followed Gond's precept of creation and innovation. The temple is made up of four main buildings, most of which are interconnected and surrounded on all sides by a courtyard full of trees and places to study or create. There is an eleven-foot wall that surrounds the entire property. Few Waterdavians venture into the House, unless to see the wonderous treasures that the followers have created.

The team was greeted by *Bari*, an elderly gnome woman, who recognized Borl from his earlier visits. The team tell Bari that they would like to talk to someone about the marionette. A bit sheepishly, she recognizes the description immediately and calls it a *nimblewright*. She told them that it was a gift to the temple about 20 years ago. She offered to fetch one of the priests, Lady Valetta, who would be able to tell them more. She invited them to look around the courtyard while she fetched the priest.

While they were waiting, they noticed the mario... nimblewright on the roof of the nearest building, watching them. Before they could react the nimblewright thew a mechanical bird at them. It flew with amazing speed and accuracy. Like a dart it crashed into Luzeiros. The mech bird, bounced off the large firbolg and flew, at little worse for its effort, back towards the roof, where the nimblewright had disappeared.

With the grace of Talos guiding his patience, Luzeiros waited until the bird was just about to the roofline and then fired off a [**shatter spell**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shatter). A thunderous sound exploded through the compound as the poor defenseless wooden trinket was blasted to oblivion, along with a good portion of the roof. As the dust settled, the shadow of the nimblewright popped up and then ducked behind what was left of the room and disappeared behind the building.

Just then Lady Valetta, priest of Gond showed up, waving her hands in front of Luzeiros and the others. Valetta was a fierce looking gold dragon, a small wisp of smoke flowing from her nose. Bari chased behind her, struggling to keep up to Lady Valetta's stride.

Valetta recognized the Tavernlords at once and was happy to show them to the nimblewright. As she led them through the temple, they saw some of the wonders. 

* A 4 -foot-tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood. iron. bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold.
* A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it
* becomes airborne.
* A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle miniature submersible has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 1363 DR." **Ursula found the submersible fascinating. Turns out that the submersible was real and really did sink.**
* A functional "waking helmet" equipped with small, articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep.
* A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "The Scarlet Marpenoth. Lantanese submersible. Launched in 1489 DR." **Like *Big Belchy*, *the Scarlet Marpenoth* is real, it was launched and has changed hands several times. The temple doesn't exactly know who owns it now.**

## Nim's Lair

Nim, (a nimblewright)

Valetta and Bari led the Tavernlords to Nim's living area, which was described as the attic version of Harry Potter's under-the-stairs closet. When the arrived at the door they found a lock that neither Vaeletta nor Bari had ever seen before. Valetta told the team to wait here, while she went to retrieve an adept to open it. She absolutely forbade them breaking the door down, with the warning delivered specifically to Luzeiros. Instead, Jarik picked the lock which turned out to be a lot less formidable than it had appeared.

Inside, Nim's room was a lot larger than Harry's. It was filled with detritus and junk of all kinds. They immediately saw the tall, spindly looking wooden nimblewright duck behind some a table. In the junk they saw broken parts of just about anything that you might find around the temple. And dozens of things that were clearly half created. Some bizarre works in progress, like what appeared to be a wooden arm.

They learned that Nim was sentient, seemingly intelligent. While it understood common, it was unable to communicate other than through a limited sign language that the temple had developed. They quickly began to feel sorry for the nimblewright. While it couldn't talk, Borl was able to [*Detect Thoughts* ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts), which allowed him to understand the creature, to a point. 

It turned out that Nim had created a second nimblewright, broken and *less smart* than Nim, it was created so that Nim would have a friend. When asked if it was the other nimblewright who fireballed the Alley, Nim thought it was possible. It came and went as it pleased. Often getting into mischief, requiring Nim to go out and drag its pieces back to the temple to re-assemble them. When asked how it found the broken nimblewright, Nim gestured at the nimblewright detector that Valetta had been beating him with.

Tempers began to rise as Valetta grew angrier and angrier with Nim, it became clear that they would have to do something to save it. There was clearly no reasoning with Valetta, Jarik unleashed his fey presence, intimidating her, and company *insist/request* that Nim help lead them to the missing nimblewright.

At first it seemed as if Valetta would reist, but in the end she dismissed them with a *"Just make sure to bring..."* seeing something that she didn't quite like, a trouble she didn't want to cross (right now), *"just go."*

## *The Eyecatcher*

To no one's surprise, Nim led the Tavernlords to the dock ward The nimblewright detector led the party to ***The Eyecatcher*** at about twilight. The most extravagant, ostentatious even ship on the docks, the *Eyecatcher* stood out against the gray winter background of the harbor. Borl's information on ***The Sea Maidens Faire*** was that the *traveling circus* is made up of three ships: *Eyecatcher*, *Hearbreaker* and *Hellraiser*. *Eyecatcher* was the carnival's flagship, while the other two transported more of the business of the show.

This evening, it looked liked activity was at a lull. There were a few deckhands on the ship, more milling about than being busy. After a brief *introduction* the party boarded and told them that they were looking for nimblewrights. One of the men went down and brought back their captain **Zardoz Zord** and a small contingent of his men back to the deck.

Despite his best efforts to invite the Tavernlords to his cabin to discuss the matter, a battle broke out.  However before the first blow was struck, ***Talos struck*** and a bolt of lightning struck the ship, disabling the vessel's *disguise spell*, revealing that the crew (except for Zord) were actually drow! 

Faced with Zord, three drow gunslingers, and two elite warriors, the team battled. Nim was sent to try to find the missing nimblewright.

And...
