# Cavalier Villa Notes

## The Cavalier Villa - December 2, 2020

The four of you are: **Goredon Ramsey aka *Grosh Ralm*** (minotaur/fighter), **Gunmetal Grey** (gnome/artificier), **Manny** (half-elf/rogue), and **Talib Beni-Asmodai** (tiefling/cleric), all members of **Force Grey**. Some of you have worked together (briefly) before, but this is your first time together. Gunmetal has a Steel Defender, a mechanical dog of sorts.
At about 2 AM you were summoned to **Cavalier Villa**, where you met with Force Grey Captain Guryon.

Cavalier Villa is a renown manor and place of notoriety in Waterdeep. It was built over a hundred years ago by *Lhorar Gildeggh, a Lord Magister*. It was built to be a gift for his most loyal Myrmidon, *Henric the Seventh*, the house served as the chief residence to some of the most esteemed warriors of various Lords for many decades. Cavalier Villa has passed through several hands since then. Most of them young noble houses or ***noble-lites***: a not so flattering nickname given to houses that come from new money or have moved to Waterdeep in *recent times*. Cavalier Villa’s history has made it a minor treasure, symbol of prestige for these noble-lites.


**Garmain DeLaurent** purchased Cavalier Villa less than a decade ago. DeLaurent’s family are considered noble-lites. Their stock has pretty much peaked, while they are still part of the social-climbing scene in Waterdeep, their star has definitely faded. In truth, their finances have not gone well and they have been struggling to keep up appearances. This information comes from a Force Grey operative, investigating rumors that DeLaurent is involved in criminal activity. The operation has, for the most part, been unsuccessful. However there is an operative who is still investigating a possible connection between House DeLaurent and the Zhentarim.

Earlier this evening ***something*** happened at Cavalier Villa. Witnesses report that there were carriages and traffic coming and going to Cavalier Villa all day and that there was some kind of party this evening. Around midnight there was a horrific sound. Some described it like children being tortured, screaming, and some said animals being slaughtered, while others reported hearing thunder or explosions. A heavy, acrid smoke-like fog has engulfed the property. Lightning can be seen darting through the sky around the top of the building.

From the stables, the Watch has surmised that there are at least seven other noble-lite houses are represented. The Watch has speculated that there are at least ten, maybe 12, of these noble-lites in there, including the DeLaurents.

## Your mission: <br>Find out what is going on and stop it; rescue as many of the nobles as you can. Preferably all of them.

*A reminder: The Force Grey motto: Arrests, not caskets. Caskets, if you insist.*

Before you were summoned, two pairs of City Watch went in to investigate, about 45 minutes apart. They appeared to have been killed and turned into zombies of some kind. You dispatched with them fairly easily, en route to the Villa.

You entered the Villa into a foyer, which was deep with thick smoke. Almost immediately a man tried to run past you to the front door, but he was intercepted by Goredon. His exact words, after Goredon tackled him were: ***“It all went wrong! It wasn’t supposed to be like this! Not him,… Asmodeus. Close the portal…”*** and *just like that, you have rescued a noble-lite,* named **Eskander Bahrami**, He is known to Talib as a businessman with some minor criminal involvement.

You have also *rescued* **Ashani**, who has all the appearance of something that may have come through that portal. She told you that there was a summoning taking place here. She says that there are forces from Hell preparing to invade. She gave you the chest and told you it was part of the summoning ritual and that it was the key to breaking the first curse. Ashani implied the first curse was the smoke. Talib identified the runes as Infernal, but could not make sense of them. Casting identify, Gunmetal was able to decipher them as a locking sequence, to unlock the chest. When Gunmetal opened the chest, the smoke and the smoke mephits did indeed go away. She has agreed to Talib, to surrender to the custody of the City Watch, if you’ll get her out of here.

In the chest there were five statues. She waited patiently for you to examine them and when you wouldn’t she gave you these descriptions, as she handled each one, narrated the fondling.

1. **A clear crystal figurine of an ice devil (6”).** *One has already escaped your grasp, the best you can do now is contain the damage;*
2.  **A blood garnet statuette of a horned devil (8”),** *an insurmountable evil amasses an army at your gates, Waterdeep is beautiful and Hell is hungry;*
3. **A green jade figurine of an aligatorian shaman (4”)** *dangerous, unrelenting foes come in all shapes and sizes;*
4. **A golden figurine of a tiger (5” length-wise),** *very dangerous, indeed…*
5. **A white star sapphire figure of a small pawn-like figure with a mask (4”),** *and the key to ending this madness is, as always, masked.*

The door and windows in the room were locked. The door and windows have some kind of magic upon them that apparently rendered them unbreakable, at least to the methods and weapons that you have tried so far.

There is one other exit from the foyer, a door opposite of the main entry. Ashani has said that there is an inferno on the other side (which you have also seen on the map. *Oops*).

## Episode Two: Doggo has hit points - December 17, 2020

Manny and Gunmetal Grey investigated the bookcases and rest of the foyer throughly for other exits or hidden secrets, but they found nothing. All that was left to do was to go through the door. A careful investigation revealed that it was free of traps, mimics and wasn't locked.

![image](/images/entry-main-v1a.jpg)

What was once a Great Hall has been caught up in flames. A torrential fire has engulfed the entire back portion of the room. However the team noticed that, on their  side of the room, only about 80 feet away, the temperature felt just above *normal*. More investigation was required. Gunmetal cast *detect magic* and the fire was indeed magic, as were Ahani and Eskander. To investigate further, he sent his robo-doggo to determine, who likely sees itself something like this:

![image](/images/robo-dog.jpg)

The Steel Defender (aka *Robbo-doggo*) helped to determine that the closer that one got to the fire, the hotter it was, more so than one might normmally expect. In other words, it was okay on the other side of the room where they came in, but right next to the fire, it was **really hot**. The team also noticed a set of footprints that bisected the room. They seemingly started somewhere near one of the doors on the left (the one above the fireplace, if anyone was keeping score) and led directly to the door on the wall on the right side. The footprints were hard to miss, as they appeared to be steaming. Two options were considered, that they were so hot that they were still burning or that they were somehow wet, producing steam. Further investigation revealed that it was indeed steam and the footprints were frozen. They were also magic, as was the sheet of ice on the door at the end of the foot path.

The door on the right was indeed frozen shut, with a layer of ice at least two inches thick. Goredon did what he does and crashed into it, substantially cracking the ice. Talib used his righteous flame to assist and the two of them took down the ice barrier without much pause. On the other side of the door they were surprised to see a heavy snow fall and a furnished recreation room covered in ice and snow. The room included a grand piano, a very comfortable sitting area and even a nook where a checkers/chess board had been set up. Also in the room were three frozen skeletons and three strange looking kobolds. These weren't your every day healthy looking greyish, brownish, redish kobold. They were a strange slate blue/grey color, everything about them screamed "cold".

![image](/images/ice-parlor.jpg)

Two of the ice kobolds (*that's what they were*) were playing checkers. The one on the right was "winning" and also cheating, a lot. The third was sitting in the sitting area reading an atlas of Faerun. One of the ice skeletons (*look I just call'em like I see'em*) was banging on the piano. The other two were pulling things out of the cabinets around the room.

Goredon was able to wander over to the pianist without causing a fuss. Everything seemed copacetic until Talib went over to inspect the checkers players. As soon as they saw his infernal looking form, the two ice kobolds (*yes, we're sticking with that*) leapt up and started screaming obsenities at him. And just like that, it was on. Seriously, though there aren't pages and pages in the rule books of *debate tables* and *synonyms* there's combat tables and weapons. A fierce battle was kinda the expected outcome here.

And fierce it was. The (ice) skeletons and kobolds battled with short swords, and bows or slings. The kobolds also cast some kind of wicked ice shard spell. Similar to *ice knife* but instead of the shard exploding, it sent a painful chill through their victims. The (ice) villains seemed particularly interested in attacking Talib and Goredon. Gunmetal Grey spent much of the fight letting his Steel Defendeer do his melee for him, instead remaining outside the cold room with the two *rescued* strangers.

For their part, neither Ashani nor Eskander wanted anything to do with going into the room and certainly wanted nothing to do with any combat. Finally, as the battle began to wind down and as the great room seemed to be getting hotter, Gunmetal convinced them to enter the room.

After the ice skeletons and ice kobolds were dispatched and throughly searched, the investigators found nothing of interest on any of them. Clearly they had been set out to perform some task, dressed for action, but unarmored. Fully loaded to bear with both weapons (mundane) and spells. Goredon collected the contraband to make sur that they didn't *fall into the wrong hands* and maybe add them to his collection or sell them as the case may be. One of you suggested checking to see if the *kobold figurine* had any effect if it was placed on the chess board squares. *Alas, still no one was brave enough to actually touch the fine carvings.* So we don't know the answer to that exquisite question. After searching the room, they decided to check on the great room, only to find that the flames had indeed spread even further and seemed even hotter. They threw the bodies of the ice skeletons into the fires to see if their cold nature would slow down the flames to no avail.

With the inferno apparently *hellbent* on cutting off their other exit, the party carefully checked the doors to the south. They were neither magic, trapped nor alive. They did however lead to another frozen room, with even more snow fall and two ominous portals. Surely there couldn't be any other dangers lurking inside, could there?

Find out on **December 30**

## Episode Three: "Smeagol" is spelled with an "O"- January 13, 2021

### The Library Portals

Carefully the party moved on to the next room, with robbo-doggo in the lead. The room is a library with two rows of shelves full of books in the middle of the room and books lining the walls. Inside the library the doggo found two portals, one hole in the ground, supported by a ledge of huge stones. A brisk cold breeze is pushed out of the hole, inside of it a whirl of snow can be seen in the make-shift well. Around the stone ledge are a few bundles of weapons and a couple of shields. All of which are covered in a sheet of ice.

Towards the back of the library, even from the entry of the room, they could make out the second portal. It hung in the air, a circular portal that stood about 12-feet tall. Framed by a circle of ice, with strange (kobold) ruins carved into the ice.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/ice-mephit.jpg) ice mephit

Guarding and operating these portals they discovered two more ice kobolds, two ice mephits and *Edel'llz* an ice kobold sorceror, who appeared to be in charge of this enitre frozen fiasco. Things such as they are, melee broke out. **Grosh** (who you may know as *Gordon*) was once again the star of the battle, beginning with a devastating dash and strike from his mighty axe to a thundering charge that took down two sets of bookcases and crashed into Edel'llz. Doggo also put up a good fight, while it seemed like the rest of the world was *hellbent* on knocking it into the ice portal. Grey, while not a big reader, found that the books around the room made excellent fodder for his [catapult](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/catapult) spell. So much so that he exhausted his spell energies! Manny and his shortbow and Talib Beni-Asmodai did their best to wrest control of the room from the kobolds and to keep their *new associates* Ashani and Eskander in line. 

Unfortunately, as soon as she saw the portal floating in the back of the room, Ashani made a break for it. Talib, who had been near the portal, but not close enough to stop her watched as she jumped through, all *Guardian on the Edge of Forever style*. He reported that she leaped through and appeared, *what looked like* about 10-15 feet in the distance and kept on running.

Talib saw that on the other side of the portal was a more rural area, no city roads and the only structures he could make out were in the distance and were much smaller than the large villas that surround Cavalier Villa outside. Wherever he was looking, wherever Ahsani had escaped to, was different. Even the weather, it was clearly no longer winter.

Meanwhile, Manny made sure that Eskander didn't also escape into the mysterious portal.


![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/kobold-shaman-edel-llz.jpg) Edel'llz

Drawn back into the battle, the kobolds and ice mephits were easily dispatched. Edel'llz was a different story, but despite his best efforts, he too was apprehended. Captured, not killed, the ice kobold sorcerer was interrogated.

Intertwined in his many threats, Edel'llz mocked the team that they were too late! **Fleagal** a devil and her army from **Stygia**, one of the levels of Hell, had already breached the portal and escaped into Waterdeep. 

>"Your *City of Splendors* will fall into a frozen ruin! The icy grip of Fleagal and a legion of her warriors have already breached your *precious crown*!"

It was clear that Edel'llz believed that the portal opened to Waterdeep. Talib knows many things and of the things that he is certain, wherever that portal opened up to, it was not where they were before they entered this cursed villa.

The second portal, Edel'llz told them was a passage to Stygia, the ice hell, where Fleagal reigned over legions of kobolds and frost giants alike. From what they gleaned from the sorcerer's ramblings, the devil has already taken an army, presumably kobolds through into *Waterdeep*

More utilitarian and less ornate than the floating portal, the portal to Stygia had some gear packs that had just been starting to get hauled up by the kobolds. About six feet across, the portal definitely did not look wide enough for a frost giant to cross through.

As they inspected it and tried to come up with a way to block the portal, they noticed that they were beginning to see a floor in the pit. Where, at first, it seemed like a bottomless drop, a stone floor seemed to be rising. Before long the portal was sealed.

The cautious type, the party barricaded the portal with bookcases and a couch to be safe.

The question remained then, follow Fleagal through the portal to *Waterdeep* or continue on the mission to rescue the nobles and figure out what is happening in the villa. It was decided that they portal would still be here afterwards and that the mission was at hand. It was decided that the party would move on through the rest of the villa, to try to unravel the mystery. 

As the party moved through the parlor, Manny dispatched Edel'llz. One less evil bastard to keep an eye or to keep out of trouble. Leaving them with only Eskander to keep an eye on.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/entry-main-v2a.jpg)

The large central room remained engulfed in flames. Grosh thought there was something *off* about the flames. He even briefly considered that they might not be real, Sure enough the heat seemed real. And as before, it seemed even hotter than it had any right to be.

There were still three doors in the room. The door to the library, the door the foyer, which we all assume still opens, right?, and one door on the far wall, by the fireplace. Ironically while the fire seemed to be spreading rampantly through the room, there was still no fire in the fireplace. In fact, as the team inspected the only door they hadn't opened, they noticed how around this side of the room the heat was more bearable. As if the flames were much, much further away than they actually are. Again, raising Grosh's suspicions. *Not enough to charge into the fire mind you*.

On the other side of the door was pitched blackness. Even those with enhanced vision couldn't make out more than a foot or two around them, not even doggo. Manny lit his lantern, Grosh lit a torch and Gunmetal tinkered with a rod to produce a magical light, that on most occasions would illuminate a large circle around him. But like other magical means, the light was quelched. 

Undeterred, the party moved into the darkness to find themselves in a cavern of sorts. Where they had expected a constructed floor and walls, they found rock walls around them and a moist, dirt. The cavern proceeded in a slight incline, maybe two percent, leading deeper into the darkness. As they moved onward, a damp stench grew worse. Vegetation, water, rot, and other offensive smells permeated the dark passage. Finally, they emerged, pushing through a dense fog and to their surprise, some foliage, they emerged,... in a swamp.


To be continued **January 27**

## Episode Four: "Can't we go back to the portal?" -  January 27, 2021

Coming out of the cave, they found themselves at the edge of a swamp. They had been pretty sure, as they moved through the cavern that they were no longer in a building, but now they were certain, they were outside. The swamp stretched out in every direction, evey beyond the small knoll behind them. On this side, the cavern opens from a small hill rising out of the muck.

Around them were a lot of insects, birds, frogs and possibly gurgling of swamp gas and just general mysterious or suspicious splashes in the surrounding water, a way off in the distance. In your immediate vicinity you can see strange birds overhead and a lot of those bugs flying and crawling around. A lot of colorfull bugs.

The smell of decayed vegetation and fragrant plants, underlying the smell of compost, was made all the worse by moist, humid heat. Their feet began to sink into the muck as Grosh began to have second thoughts about this course of action. A discussion ensued and during the conversation Grosh picked the four-inch, green figurine of the *aligatorian shaman*. While it appeared to be jade, Grosh deduced that it wasn't, it was definitely heavier, more like stone or a rock. From a distance it appeared to be a *fine figure*, but up close he could tell that the carving was crude and rough.

Seeing that the minotaur didn't burst into flames, Gunmetal Grey picked up the golden tiger. Like the *shaman*, the tiger figurine wasn't made out of gold, it was much heavier and the color was darker, almost bronze. The stripes, while they appeared to be solid carvings, were actually some kind of script (*rakshaha*). Gunmetal cast [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) and revealed that the statue was not magic, but was magicked into existance when ***D’nani Yrrakis***, a rakshaha, crossed through *a portal*.

The discussion continued, on and on. Finally, Talib cast [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury) to help divine their best path. Paraphased as ***"Would going through the ice portal, would that lead to a resolution to the problem in the villa?*** Carefully he threw his five ceremonial knives and translated the direction of the blades and the turns of the bejeweled hilts.
> ***Weal and Woe***, a whisper floated through the small recess of Talib's mind: *Travel through the portal may prevent catastrophe, but will not save the villa*)

And it was decided, the agents of Force Grey turned back into the cavern and travelled back down the cavern. They travelled through the main chamber and back into the ice parlor and then into the library. Everything was just as they had left it. The portal that once lead to Styggia was still covered by a pile of bookcases, presumably still closed. The other, the ice portal, also remained open. On the other side, they could see the same sunny, rural area that they saw before.

They tested the portal again, this time Grosh put a crossbow bolt through and brought it back, without breaching the portal himself. Gunmetal sent *doggo* through with instructions to come back, but it went through and stood there, with it's metal tail wagging. Boldly, Grosh stepped through the portal and stood next to doggo. He found himself in a rural countryside, with a small villiage down the road and a mountain range to the north (west). To his dismay, he turned and saw that there was no portal.

In, I'd like to say *desperation* or *an abundance of concern* but..., Gunmetal attached a rope to a bolt and fired it at Doggo, hoping to be able to give Grosh a line back to them. But the bolt flew into the countryside, hit the end of the rope and dropped to the ground. They couldn't see it near Grosh and Grosh couldn't see it.

Enraged, Eskander couldn't believe that they were actually considering going through the portal. Done with his charge's nonsense, Manny grabbed Eskander and tossed him through the portal. Unceremoniously he tumbled through and landed near Grosh's hooves.

While they team continued to discuss options, including leaving Grosh behind, and continuing to investigate the house (their mission), three kobolds approached Grosh and took up an aggressive posture. Acting in their nature, the lawmen, stepped through the portal and took Grosh's side. Two of the kobolds were dispatched handily, the third made a run for it, terrified by Grosh. He didn't get make it very far before Grosh charged over and grappled him into submission.

The strangest part of the interrogation of the kobold was that it had never even heard of Waterdeep, which was, to say the least distressing. He claimed to work for some dwarves up in ***Melairbode***. While no one else had heard it, the name rang a bell for Manny. After a moment of thought, *"Oh shit, I think we're 2000 years in the past."* (paraphased)

While coming to terms what could be their new predicament, a lone rider and a wagon came down the road toward them. The rider, Aaron, was sent to protect the three halflings who were on their way to meet some dwarves to trade wares. Typically, the hamlet and dwarves deal on *market days*, but this was a special arrangement. Judging them based on their appearance, *I mean a minotaur and a...whatever Talib is...*, he decided that they must be one of those travelling performing troops that he'd heard of back east. In what would have been parting, Manny warned him about the kobolds, but told him not to worry, that they'd been dispatched, the young Aaron seemed a bit concerned. Cautiously he asked whether the group would be interested in coming with them, and after he would make sure that they had a place to stay and some food for the evening.

The meeting with the dwarves was mostly unventful. The dwarves traded them some ore and small metals for some crafts. On the whole it didn't really seem like a fair deal, but the dwarves seemed happy with it. Gunmetal sought to find an audience with the dwarves king. These dwarves, who had never in their lives even seen the king, were amused by the travelling bards. A ruse made whole by Grosh producing his lyre! While they were in no position to offer an royal audience, they did suggest that the troop come back and perform their show for the dwarves and *see what happens*.

After a long day, that may have started a couple millennium from their meeting with the dwarves, Force Grey finaly made it to the hamlet of ***Tyr's Burden***. 

Tyr's Burden was a very small hamlet that started with 36 pioneers looking to start a new frontier. With dreams of creating a farming community, to do Tyr's work, they moved west. The majority of them came from the outskirts of a town called Morinden, which had become increasingly oppressive over the past few years. The lord of Morinden had steadily increased taxes on their produce and had even begun to tax the church. 

Led by **Maurice**, a young human cleric from *Tyr's Hold*, the local temple, six families and a handful of weary travelers head west. **Tyson**, Maurice's brother, who had been a local hero among the farmers was the natural choice to be the town's *mayor*. And **Horace Broadsword**, who was a guard in Morinden and somewhat of an *adventurer* in his youth, was the perfect choice to be the hamlet's *constable*.

Grateful for their service escorting Aaron and the halflings, Tyson offered them tents as a place to stay and invited them to join the residents in their communal evening meal. Talib, instead retired to his tent to commune with Helm. For the most part, a good time was had by all. At the end of the evening, Horace and Tyson pulled Manny and Grosh aside to tell them that they could tell that they were more than some *travelling minstrels*. From the team's garments and their weaponry they knew that they were less than civilian. They confided that the hamlet had been having trouble with orcs. Four times in the past few months a band of, no more than a dozen, orcs had rampaged through Tyr's Hold. They told the party that they were a small, new, but had hopes to become a legitimate town. They didn't have much, but would come up with a way to compensate Force Grey for their assistance. Tyson mentioned, that he had heard that they were looking for an audience with the king of the dwarves. He admitted that their contacts didn't go that high up, but offered to do what they could as partial payment. 

A deal was struck.

***It was agreed four days would pass between now and the next campaign.*** During this time, the party would settle in and learn what they could about their new surroundings. Specifically, Gunmetal intended to make an arrangement with the local dwarf family that had set up a smith business to lease space and their tools. So far, the agreed to allow time as a *retainer* for help with the orcs.

If there are any other **specific** things that anyone would like to do, or try to learn, let me know.
Otherwise:

***ORC-HUNT begins on February 10th***
