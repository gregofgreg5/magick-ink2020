## The Illefarn Portal Ruins
Harriet flew another reconnaissance from above and the rest of the team scouted the top of the mesa. There were three distinct ruins, all appeared to be about the same size and just about the same shape, but only the one closed to the edge of the mesa had enough pieces in place that it looked like much of anything.

The alabaster stones, arranged in a concentric circle, were different from the lime-green ring around the strange pool of clear liquid, with a murky, white cloudy substance below the surface. And the large stone arch were identical to the same structures at the Temple of Ramenos.

The two structures were definitely out of place, neither recorded in any previous information regarding the portal ruins. From what they could tell, the pool and the arch were new!

They looked into the arch and saw an enormous cavern with a subterranean forrest that stretched out as far as the eye could see. Aside from the vegetation, the only other living things that they could see were these strange creatures that looked like a cross between a bat and a pelican. As Harriet flew out into the cavern, they saw the the creatures paid little attention to her, drawing away from her more than approaching.

The team checked their supplies and went into the cavern, slowly making their way down the embankment to the path below. Rameele and Shiluo navigated the incline but Irasav slipped and almost fell off the ledge into a seemingly bottomless drop. He righted himself and jumped down to the path below.

## The forest
On the other side of the path, Harriet flew over a small stream that wove across the cavern, on one side was the rich forrest path and on the other was another perilous drop, like the other one a few hundred feet away, this drop appeared to fall forever into darkness, but a strange mist could be seen down below.

Shiluo investigated the water and determined that it was most likely some kind of glacial or mountain run off. It was definitely fresh water and cold, very cold. Looking upstream, the stream or small river and the forest appeared to stretch on forever, perhaps even... outside of the cavern at some point.

The cavern was huge, it stretched on for miles. Beams of sunlight or moonlight, it was hard to say, cut through the darkness, illuminating the forest enough to make out the vague shape of the subterranean wilderness.

There was, without a question a yearning in all of the to find out more about this strange underground world. But, there was a more important mission and that path appeared to lead to the building carved and built into the side of the cavern.

## The Illefarn Portal Engine
The pathway to the building was remarkable in that it was an actual pathway of stone, what looked like paved stone, with borders on either side. On the flat stone borders, an unrecognizable series of glyphs or symbols ran from the beginning of the path up to the building and around the doorway. Harriet recognized a few of the symbols from the ones that she had seen in Tal's journals.

Irasav peeked his head into the building, where he saw a beauitful ante chamber. A very different, elaborate feel to the room, nothing like the ordinary, almost rustic appearance of the outside of the chamber. In the back of the chamber was a large (10 foot tall) door.

The rest of the team quickly joined Irasav and they entered the chamber. Taking care to inspect the door, they opened it, revealing a spectacular scene.

Epic in it's construction, the inside of the building is made of some kind of beautiful while stone with two large visible portals and an ornamental door, with a closed stone door. A slope of stairs lead up to a strangely lit window at the back of the room.

A channel, a stream of a strange, clear liquid ran along the left side of the room and appeared to run underneath a spectacular and familiar looking pool.

There were five elves in the room.  Three of them wore a very thin chainmail and brandishing different weapons: a larger crossbow, a spear & shield and one wielding a scimitar. The other two, taller, less burly elves, a male and female wore more ornate robes. The female carried a thin staff, while her male companion wore what appeared to be an ornate short staff or large wand on his hip.

Cyan'dar, the female who appeared to be in charge, greeted Irasav and the rest of the group. She invited them in and asked what had brought them to this fine place.

It's when she spoke that they first noticed the horrific sound coming from the ceiling. Above them there was a bizarre cacophony of colors flashing and clashing, with the horrific sound of metal, a lot of different metal items crashing together, being ground together. As their eyes cleared, they realized that both portals and the doorway and even the water had a strange reflection of the chaotic light show shining around, framing them.

The team had seen this color show and horrible sound before, when the gem on the snake erupted, changing them all.

Their inspection was interrupted when the woman repeated her welcome, asking them their business and where they had come from, in elvish.

Irasav responded, telling them that were travelers, on a mission, looking for two missing adventurers: *Einrich and Tal*. 

Cyan'dar recognized the names as Elvish and a conversation was begun. She explained that the building that they were in was an *engine* or a *control mechanism* of sorts, which was integrated into the ancient Illefarn Portal system. 

She explained that the portals themselves closed over 1200 years ago, and this room was more vestigial than active. Her and her *associates* were an *honor guard* left behind to keep the room safe and orderly. When Harriet asked, Cyan'dar explained that there was no chance that these portals could be opened again, the magics that powered them are gone, all that remained were the powerful arches and strange liquid that seemed to run through the *engine* like a river.

Shiluo looked the liquid over carefully, while he was quick to touch and taste the water in the subterranean forest, he could tell this was different. For one, this wasn't water. It was very similar to the liquid that they saw in the Temple of Ramenos. He asked her about the liquid and the pool.

Cyan'dar explained that the liquid, the *khh'am-shriah'ai*, was the *lifeblood* of the machine.

The host told them that no one had come to the cave in over a thousand years. The team explained that they thought that this place must still be active somehow and detailed the Seeping Woods hunting party that they dispatched outside of the ruins and of their experience at the Temple of Ramenos, including their experience with the strange *underwater version of the temple*.

When Rameele detailed the events with the staff/*key*, all of the elves appeared to become more interested. Cyan'dar pressed for more information about *the key*. She became almost focused on seeing it. It wasn't until they clarified that they had to leave the staff behind in order to return to the ruins of Ramenos, that she relented.

Remeele and Irasav devised a plan to try to gain favor of the elves. They offered to prove that the portals were still active. They sent Harriet out to retrieve the head of one of the armanites.

Looking into the portal nearest to them, they saw the ruins of Ramenos, that they had left about a week before. Remeele volunteered to go back and see if she could find any trace of the staff. After a quick test, throwing a torch through the portal and bringing it back, they attached the same rope to Remeele and sent her through.

## Return to the Temple of Ramenos
Harriet returned with her gross prize, which was neither useful nor surprisingly upsetting to the elves. Still, they appreciated the effort. Sort of. By the time Harriet had gotten back to the group, Rameele had gone through the portal. She watched in amazement as Rameele moved through the ruins.

Rameele knew she wasn't going to find the staff. Or at least she assumed she wasn't going to find the staff. Still, she made a good show of looking around.

It was night. In the distance Remeele could hear something... somethings moving closer. She could her *them* moving through the mere, making hungry sounds, moving towards her. *Time was short*, she couldn't hang out here all night.

She checked the rope, tugging on it once and when the team returned the signal, that everything was still fine, she went over to the pool.

The pool was exactly like she remembered. Clear liquid with a murky, cloudy substance a few feet below the surface. Exactly like she remembered it, from here and from the elf's *machine*. The two pools were identical.

She looked around again, unamused by the circumstance that she found herself in: getting nowhere with the elves, knowing that there was nothing here to find, but still, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were getting closer to something. There was something about the elves and their machine. *Something*...

She looked into the pool. *The same as the elf's*... The same. *The lifeblood of the machine*... the same. She dipped her hand into the liquid.

From the other side of the portal, the rest of them stared in amazement. *Maybe she saw the staff!* Harriet thought. 

*She's fucked* Shiluo thought.

Irasav and the elves watched with anticipation. 

For Remeele it felt like an eternity. She could feel her breath rushing through her, like she was in combat or telling a good story, a really great story. And she started to remember the stories: the good ones, the bad ones. All of them. She *pulled her hand out*... she tried to pull her hand out, but she couldn't. She was stuck. 

Suddenly it wasn't just her breath she could feel moving through her, but her... *life essence* she could feel the energy of the liquid moving through her, like she was drowning in it, like she was in an avalanche. 

And then she was gone.

From the other side of the portal, the team watched as she put her hand in the pool. She seemed frozen for a second and then she fell backwards.

Irasav and Shiluo pulled her body through the portal. But by the *time* she was on the other side, she was already dead.

## Enough is enough

While the team moved in to attend to Remeele's body, Galungorm, the male host, shook his head and said in common, "Enough is enough" and spoke a strange word, suddenly the short staff in his hand transformed into a short sword. Without any other warning, the elves attacked.

Galungorm stepped forward and cut into Irasav, then lifted his other hand over the dragonborn's eyes and cast [blindness](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Blindness%20Deafness#content) on Irasav. 

Before anyone could approach her, Harriet took a step back and then took the wing. She swept out and used her Quilinbian Whip on one of the elfin guards with the unusual crossbow.

The High Guard centurion with the spear (*Hoplite's doru*, by name if you must know) lashed out and struck Shiluo. The guard-*elf* with the double-crossbow fired two bolts at Harriet, catching her with one of them. The third centurion's scimitar lit up with a brilliant flame and he lashed out at Irasa with two strikes, missing the dragonborn with the first but connecting with the second.

One of the centurions cursed at Irasav in a language that was definitely not elvish. Rather it was either *Abyssal* or *Infernal*... one of the others responded, in the same foul voice.

Remeele suddenly opened her eyes, her very life *rushing back into her body*. But she was changing, something was still happening to her, she could still feel the liquid, the power, the magic of the *lifeblood of the machine* working it's magic on her. She sat up, smaller in stature, still larger than she was before she reached the mere. Smaller and... *younger*!

Before she came to the mere Remeele had already made a name for herself in more than one circle. In fact, with more than one name. Even though she was, *young* by human standards, she had been a successful *adventurer* and *sellsword* for over a decade. She had already left copies of two journals with the Diegesis at Westgate. 

Enraged Irasav struck Galungorm with two out of three blows, pushing him back on his heels. He put his hand to his bloodied nose, then looked at Irasav and grinned...

*What **is** going on here???*
*Who are these **elves**?*
*Where does that second portal hold?*
*...And what is behind that door...?*
