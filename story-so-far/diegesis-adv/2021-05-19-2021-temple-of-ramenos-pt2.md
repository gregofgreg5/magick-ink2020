## Lorath

Lorath, the bullywug battle captain, watched his charmed minions wander off into the mere and found himself facing the Diegeis team on his own. He had already hurled burst of flame at Shilou and then turned his attention to the aarakocra and Irasav. Fire flew through the mere, scorching the adepts.

Harriet moved her [flaming sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere) on top of him, returning the favor. Shilou attacked with his light hammer,*the Shard of Lyryaan* dealing both melee and tremendous thunder damage and Irasav threw two shuriken at the bullywug. Remeele cast [vicious mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vicious-mockery) but Lorath resisted it.

The captain was tougher than he looked and the flame he threw from axe was devastating. But the diegesis team were relentless, forcing Lorath to resort to one of his greatest powers: he summoned aid. Suddenly a giant crocodile emerged between Lorath and the Diegesis team.

Harriet moved her *flaming sphere* over to the crocodile. Shilou turned his deadly weapon on the beast as well. The crocodile retaliated biting at Shilou with it's mighty jaws and smashed Irasav with it's huge tail. 

Irasav turned inwards and used his ki to heal some of the damage he had sustained, while Remeele tried *vicious mockery* again, this time the biting attack left Lorath scalded. Undaunted, Lorath continued his flaming assault on Harriet. 

Harriet dove down to cast [false life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/false-life) to heal some of the damage that she had suffered, then moved the *flaming sphere* to make sure it stayed on the crocodile. Meanwhile Lorath and Irasav continued their battle. 

Shiluo smashed the crocodile and it swung it's tail back at him and crashed Harriet in his mighty jaws, smashing her burning body in it's maw. It crushed her in it's mouth and shook.

Irasav turned his attention to the croc. In a flurry of deadly strikes with his short sword, the dragonborn cleaved into the giant creature, killing it, causing it to drop the broken aarakocra. Remeele rushed over to her side and cast [cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) on Harriet and she came back from the brink the death with a deep gasp. With a righteous anger, she leaped to her feet and took to the wing. She let loose one of her flechettes, it split in to three pieces and struck down Lorath. 

The bullywug wobbled, grasped it's great axe tighter and fell back dead. In it's death throes, it shook and shimmered as it reverted to it's natural form...

An advantage of being a team seeped in knowledge, Irasav and Shilou were confident that the creature, dead before them, was a batrachi!

>**Legend of the batrachi**
>
>The grotesque batrachi were once a powerful race that were said to have warred with titans. In about -30,000 DR (some 31,500 years ago) they were chased from this plane into Limbo. Strange and dangerous, these creatures whose numbers were once staggering were servants of the deity Ramenos.
>
>It is believed today that the batrachi may have been some distant relation to the vile sladdi. In fact, because Ramenos had been known to have reshaped the batrachi as he needed, it is sometimes believed that the slaadi are just a lesser form of this strange *sometimes thought to be extinct* war-craving race.

Finding themselves either wounded or having expelled their resources, it was decided that the team would make shelter and rest before heading up to the ruins of the temple. They created a shelter and Harriet used [druidcraft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/druidcraft) to help fortify it and they settled in to rest and recover.

## The Ruins

The long rest passed without event. Refreshed and recovered, Shilou was the first of the team to approach the temple. The *temple* turned out to be more ruins than an actual building. All that was left was the lowest level of stones that once made up the temple walls and some of the interior features. The area right around the stones had a very dense atmospheric pressure, which Shilou found out the hard way. As soon as he was within a few feet of the stones he began to feel as if the very air was heavier, like there was some kind of drag on him, it was so painful that he began to have an excruciating headache and his body began to feel like it was being crushed. A bit phased, he quickly retreated back to the team and told them what he had learned.

Harriet took to the wing again and flew about 50 feet above the ruins and peered down at the archaic stones. She returned and reported that whatever it was didn't extend to where she had flown.

Shilou went back and found the phenomenon was just as bad as before if not worse. Harriet and Remeele followed, lower this time, and also found the pressure excruciating. Only the dragonborn, Irasav, was uneffected. 

Almost before they could begin to investigate the strange effect, it ended. The strange pressure lifted immediately as Harriet entered the actual ruins. The rest of the team moved in and began to look around the historic area.

They were not the first diegesis adepts to investigate these ruins. There had been maps and other sketches drawn, but such is the way of the Academy that each comes upon the world through their own eyes and experience and adds their insight their story to the Narrative. So each began their own exploration, looking for clues to the long dead adepts and what *they* might have been looking for.

Shilou went to investigate the stone archway. He found the structure more intact than any other part of the ruins. He could clearly make out that the arch way was an entrance, if not the main entrance to the temple. He took note of the ornamental runes on the ruins, which he deduced were more ornamental or ceremonial than functionally magic.

Harriet had gone to the explore the stones arranged in a circle near the arch. Like the arch, it was more intact than the rest of the temple, but unlike the arch it was less clear what these were. It was some kind of circle, with indecipherable runes carved into them. She looked carefully to see if there were any markings that she recognized from her studies. She even checked them against the parchment of symbols which she had scribed before she left Westgate. They were similar, but not enough that she could say that they were related. **More importantly she was not certain that they looked like they were of carved when the temple was functional. *Had they come later?***

As Remeele and Irasav looked around the stones, the mere seemed to rise beneath them. They were able to ascertain that this was very likely the ruins of the temple of Ramenos. As they inspected the stones, the murky water oof the mere that usually lay on the surface or just beneath it, began to rise and quickly reached their ankles. Looking around to alert the others, they saw that Shilou was staring at the walls above him. *Walls!!!*

Where only seconds ago there was only stones on the ground, walls, glowing an eerie lime green, were beginning to appear. Translucent, almost transparent, the walls went up and formed a domed ceiling about 30 feet above their heads. A few feet beneath the arc of the dome, were small *windows* glowing with iridescent colors.

Too seasoned to be astonished or shocked, a new level of alertness came over the group. A level of concern that escalated when they saw that a strange pool had appeared in the ring of stones in front of Harriet.

As he went to join the others at the new pool, Shilou noticed that on the other side of the archway was no longer the mere, but it appeared that they were underwater. Very deep underwater. By the time he reached the rest at the pool, the water beneath them had risen above their knees, and had changed. It was no longer the murk of the swamp. Shilou dipped his finger in it and smelled it, **careful not to *lick it***, he was certain that it was ordinary seawater. 

They investigated the stones around the pool. Remeele was able to discern that the set-up here, like the arch way, were more ceremonial, if any kind of magic it appeared to be divination that the runes suggested. And while they were examining the cloudly, almost milky pool, which swirled around slowly, a strange figure appeared in the center of the temple.

## the Caretaker
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/caretaker-sm.jpg?raw=true)

An obvious amphibian creature, it was dressed in an ornate and ceremonial robe, befitting the once-grand majesty of this temple. It appeared unarmed and even it's web hands looked more functional for motion than attacking. They were too wise to assume it was harmless, but it certainly didn't present an imposing figure.

>Welcome, Ramenos has waited a long time, patiently waiting for the *key* to return.

It gestured towards Harriet. Harriet nodded knowingly and held up the staff. It confirmed that the staff was indeed the key and it was clear that it wanted her to put the staff in the pool.

>It is the way out, it is beautiful, but sadly not complete... as it is, it cannot restore the old temple, but it will save you and it will return home to where it belongs.

Quickly Irasav asked where they were.

>We are in the grand old temple that was, that will be again and is also the place from where you came.

Irasav took in this information and closed his eyes, focusing his ki, reaching out. Having some experience in this *arena* he was certain that they had not physically moved, but were no longer on the same plane of existence. And he wasn't sure how he knew exactly, but he was sure that they hadn't gone back (or forward) in time.

The dragonborn, refocused on the creature, told it that they were looking for a lost volume, a book that belonged to their order, and asked if the creature had seen it or could help them. 

>There was once a great library here, beautiful tablets, tomes and skins of many kinds. Like the gorgeous walls of this temple, those too are long gone. There is nothing here *now* but what you see.

And again, he urged that they should put the key into the pool, as there would be no other way for them to get home. To return to safety.

One of them wondered out loud what would happen if they took the key and went through the arch way?

>Surely you would be dead before too long, unless you can breath water, and *one of us* would go out and retrieve the key. 

Keyed on "one of us", Remeele asked, "Are you referring to you or are there more of you?"

It paused, thought about it and replied that there were *of course* more, that he was but a humble servant whose job it was to care for the temple and greet *visitors*.

They asked about Einric and Tal, telling the creature that they were also searching for these people who had been searching for the temple.

It said that it could tell them nothing of them, that it could tell them nothing about any other travelers.

The party discussed their options, uncertain at some of the creatures answers. All they could discern for certain was that there was little where they were, that it was unlikely that they could walk (swim) out of the archway and that appeared to be the only way out. No one, **no one**, was considering going into the pool and the creature had even said that it was not a portal or something for people, but was meant for the key.

They were equally convinced that giving the creature the key was unlikely to be their best bet. And that their only leverage was that the *caretaker* seemed very interested in them putting the key in the pool.

Finally the caretaker interrupted them and told them that it could tell them no more, but that the key could show them all that there was to know. It told Harriet to wave the key slowly over the pool. It told them to look into the pool as she waved the key.

Seeing no harm, they agreed and she did as she was bid. As she did, the milky clouds in the water became more active, swirling about, changing directions *chaotically*. And finally changing colors.

The water grew dark, not murky, but a sullen and dark, cloudy gray and then the dark of night and it revealed:
> A pitched battle at the Weeping Willow Inn, but it looked like the bad guys (some goblins and strange warriors) had already taken the inn. At the last second, they saw a dragonborn, bronze like Irasav, and another figure lurking in the distance, moving in to strike...
 
The darkness came over the water again and swirled furiously until it became bright, as if there were a golden light shining in the pool revealing:
> A shinning army, a platoon of soldiers clad in plate mail carrying a banner that they could not quite make out, in formation as if preparing to go to war...

Again the water became cloudy and a darker green and then lighter blue, then darker blue before opening to:
> The docks of Waterdeep, a place familiar to all of them in their travels. A dark shadow fell across the pier and then quickly the vision panned back as the shadow spread out across the Sword Coast, over the Mere, expanding again once it came to Leilon and expanding...seemingly to picking up momentum and mass, heading towards Neverwinter...

Blackness filled the pool, broken suddenly by another swirl of clouds and then a lightning storm of colors, and then again the vision changed to night, this time in the Mere:
> ... where a very large black willow tree sat in a small clearing. The tree was jet black and flashes of brilliant colors burst out of it, almost blinding on the dark background. The colored lights flashed like explosions, changing their hue and brightness randomly, chaotically... *they could imagine hearing a terrible sound, metal grinding against metal shrill and shrieking*...
 
The chromatic assault accelerated and then went blinding white, fading back to tree. The tree in the dead of night in the mere, over the willow:
> The vision pans past the tree, continuing in the mere, toward what appeared to be the ruins, approaching from the opposite side that they used. Quickly the scene moved through a rudimentary graveyard, heading towards the temple. Suddenly in the foreground, moving towards the ruins, a handful of undead appeared and also heading towards the ruins.
 
The sound of water, the roar of the ocean at it's loudest, grew fiercely around them. For the first time, they were surrounded by the experience of sound and not light this time. Their senses were overloaded and when the sound dissipated enough for them to use their eyes again:
> Their vision was following a rush of water as it roared through a tunnel or some kind of cavern, emerging in a building that looked a lot like what they thought this temple might have been like, but at the same time felt very different. The room appeared to be lined with strange archways, *portals*, with shadowy figures moving all about the dim background, a large... *frog-shape* could be seen forming....

Confused and a little disturbed they pressed the caretaker to explain what they had just seen. It tried to explain, but it finds *common* so difficult to articulate accurately. It told them that the key opened their vision to what was happening, to the glorious things that were taking place, that were set in motion.

They asked if they put the key in the pool whether it would take them to one of those places?

It explained, again, getting a little exasperated, that the key would only return them to the ruins, of the once great temple, *where they were* as it were.

The team reconvened. Remeele and Irasav were certain that they recognized the location, as unlikely as it seemed, they both believed that they were looking at the *long defunct* Illefarn Portals.

>**Legend of the Illefarn portal ruins**, *in brief.*
>
>In the mere, not far from West Harbor, these portals were once part of the *Illefarn* elfin city-state that thrived around -21,000 DR (21,500 years ago).These elfin portals were said to once be a mighty transportation system, closed and localized though and between one another, certainly ***not*** interplanar. But really, only there was only conjecture about the their true purposes during when they stood. Like these temple ruins, they had been explored many times over the years, mostly a long, long time ago. But there was enough that they were sure that between the four of them there was a lot of knowledge to be shared...
>

Thinking about the Illefarn portal ruins, ***something almost clicked*** for Harriet. Something about the long-dead ruins of the Illefarn... the portal ruins... *another* ancient site... *what if Einric & Tal's path wasn't to the Temple of Ramenos! but to the portals ruins? Or **what if they were somehow connected**...*
