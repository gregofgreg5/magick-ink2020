## Journey at Sea
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/admirals-yalman.jpg?raw=true)
The *Admiral's Yalman*

The journey from Westgate was  uneventful, and after a getting acquainted, the four adventurers spent more time keeping busy than getting to know one another. This was not an uncommon practice among members of the Academy, as even their stories about one another tended to come from their direct experiences with one another and there were always so many other interesting or potentially interesting people to get to know in their orbit.

Shiluo de lung, one of the ship's sea masters, whose job it was to help plot the course, was busy. In addition to his actual job on the ship, he was also a valuable *other right hand* to the *Admiral's Yalman's* captain the famed *merchant sailor* Pierre St. Risquar. St. Risquar didn't like leaving his valued crew member and friend behind, but part of this fare was to deliver the cargo with an escort and the Diegesis College had requested and even paid extra for Shiluo to accompany their team on this mission.

It was less of a burden, or even a concern, for the captain that the transient dragonborn deck hand, Irasav, had also taken a contract to join the Diegesis party. Irasav had come aboard the *Yalman* only a few months earlier. His good nature, strong back and reliable nature had made him a good fit on the ship, but St. Pierre knew the type. Irasav was one of those *not quite mercenary* types who would take odd jobs at various ports, the kind that you didn't wait for very long if they missed their scheduled call to return. Already he had taken jobs at several ports. Each time, St. Pierre was a little surprised that he didn't just keep moving.

The two Diegesis passengers that the *Yalman* took on in Westgate were characters in their own right. Of course Harriet, the very colorful Aarakocra, who had been brought on 

Harriet, the colorful Aarokocra, one of the fares that the College had booked passage, was clearly some kind of spellcaster. A wizard, if Captain St. Pierre was any judge of such matters. In his experience there were three kinds of wizards: the loud, flashy, flamboyant irritating jerks; the quiet, observant, aloof and usually no-trouble ones who mostly kept to themselves; and the ones with real power who couldn't help but give off an irrepressable menace, a presence, he hated those guys. Harriet was a bit of an *odd bird* in that she was mostly quiet and aloof, but she didn't keep to herself as much. She spent as much time with the deckhands and crew as she did in her quarters. *Friendly* though, and definitely sh didn't seem to be any trouble. St. Pierre kind of even liked her.

The other passenger that the College had sent was a different: *Remeele*. He had heard of a *Remeele*, a female adventurer, a mercinary who made her fame up and down the Sword Coast, mostly in the north. Her legend had been around for quite a few years. The Captain was a little surprised that she appeared so young. Still, she fit the bill, she was confident and seemingly competent and was a master at telling her tales. She regularly had the crew engrossed in her fabulous stories of her adventures.

For her part, this was not the first time that the bard known as *Remeele* had been to sea. In fact, the last time was when she had crewed with the *Star of the Morning*, for over a year. At the time, she also passed herself as an *illusionist*, using mostly [prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/prestidigitation) to entertain the crew and pocket a few more coins. Of course, they didn't knew her by a different alias. Still, being on the water, in a small, confined ship with a limited audience was not her favorite way to spend her time.

## Arrival at the Mere of Deadmen

While West Harbor was a frequent destination for the *Admiral's Yalman* the College had elected to not pay the port fee to dock there on this leg of the trip and instead chose to have their team dropped directly on shore at the mere, to get them there faster. Of course the *Yalman* was too big to land in the marsh, so de lung arranged for them to be dinghy-ed to shore. He had also arranged for the *Yalman* to pick them back up at West Harbor in 15 days, enough time for the ship to complete it's run to Neverwinter and for them to complete their investigation. About a two days trek by foot from where they were deposited, this gave the adepts plenty of time to poke around the area.

The safest location to land the dinghy was on a marshy *beach head* that had access to a small landing, from the landing there were two clear paths through the swamp that the party could take: one to the west and one to the east.

Harriet, took the the wing, and flew above them, scouting the area and indeed, both paths led into the distance as far as she could see. Shiluo checked his charts and the suspected location of the temple ruins were to the north-east. A clear path was decided and they started to head to the east.

## Chester

As soon as they stepped out of the marsh brush and on to the path, even before they could head to the west, a booming, loud, friendly voice beckoned to them. They turned to see a magnificent tree in the clearing just to the east, calling to them, welcoming them even.

This is Chester. He will welcome them and tell them that he is a steward of *Teek'l Dayn*. That if it’s trouble that they seek they have come to the right place, there’s no safety here. If they won’t turn around and leave, he tells them that he hopes that their deaths will be quick and meaningful and that they aren’t leaving behind too many loved ones. In order to provide as much succor as he can he offers to answer one question each. He tells them that he is incapable of lying or telling only partial truths, no matter how disturbing or painful that the answers might be.That if it’s trouble that they seek they have come to the right place, there’s no safety here.

>Irasav: What secrets do the wisest of travelers learn when making their way through the swamp?
>*Humbly, I wouldn't presume to know what the wisest ones know or ask... I wouldn't presume to judge the wisdom of my guests*

Having been unable to answer the dragonborn's question, Chester allowed him another:
>What is the best way to ensure our success in reaching our goals?
>*If your goal is a long and prosperous life, you should go back to your skiff and take the next tide out. If your goal is to proceed into Teek'l Dayn, then trust no one and nothing beyond these roots.*

Having seen the immediate terrain from above, the route itself was on the aarakocra's mind.
>Harriet asked: What's the safest route to the ruins from where we're standing?
>*There has been a lot of traffic out those ol' ruins lately. The littlest amount of time you spend in Teek'l Dayn, the safer you will be. The fastest way, is along that path behind you. Fastest, deadly. But they're all deadly.*

His interest piqued by the massive tree's repeated reference to deadly dangers, Shiluo put forth:
>What dangers are out there?
>*There is danger behind every branch, in the bubbling swamp and still water. Traps and foes at every turn. I only hope that your deaths are quick and painless.*

Remeele picked up on something that the tree said.
>You said that there was increased traffic, how many other people have been asking about the Temple of Ramenos? And who?"
>*Wugs of course, the wugs are always going back and forth, hoping and crawling over those ruins... mostly wugs. But other miscreants, usually with them.

## The *Friendly Glade*
As the team moved carefully through the marsh, they came upon a small glade with a stand of four trees. Among them, to their trained eyes, stood out as different. The approached with caution, almost ready when the trunk began to whip and turn and the branches swung around above them. A giant crocodile maw and head forming in the trunk. It rose and towered over the party.

Massive, mighty and terrifying. Jaws that looked like they could snap a person in half in a blink. The *friendly tree* lashed out, tearing into Harriet. 

Irasav slid forward and unleashed a flurry of three attacks with his blade and four unarmed strikes flew around the creature, smashing and slicing into it. 

Shiluo pulled out his small but beautiful golden hammer, that looked almost too delicate to be a weapon. He stepped up beside Irasav and struck, smashing into the trunk with a mighty blow. 

The chaotic dance continued as Rameele's scimitars flashed and Harriet's whip stung into the tree. Suddenly the thing lumbered, sunk a little and then *dove* forward into the marsh, the surface of the swamp swished and swooshed as the creature traveled beneath them. Remeele and Harriet found themselves sinking into the muck, even as the creature emerged again behind them.

Shiluo stepped in a delivered a devastating blow from the Shard of Lyryaan. The tiny weapon released a powerful wave of magic leaving the monster confused and staggered. Irasav unleashed another flurry of blows and savage cuts into the monster. Before Shiluo came back and finished, channeling his divinity through The Shard, causing it to swell from the trunk and it's maw exploded, showering them all with muck and swamp.

Remeele freed herself from the sinking quagmire and applied aid to Harriet's wounds. But before they could do much more than take stock of their own injuries, Irasav noticed a pack of bullywugs approaching from the north.

Seven wugs and a *captain* behind their pack came out of their ambush positions. But this wasn't some novice squad of rookies, these were four seasoned and trained adepts.

Remeele stepped forward and cast [hypnotic pattern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hypnotic-pattern) across the field, catching five of the seven wugs in her power and rendered them harmless. Irasav smashed one of the remaining wugs and Remeele finished off the last of them, leaving only their leader, *Lorath* and his axe, a blaze with flame between them and the temple ruins...
