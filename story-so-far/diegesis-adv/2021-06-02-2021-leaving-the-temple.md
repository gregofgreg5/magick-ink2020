# Inside the Temple that Once Was And is Again

The caretaker was growing impatient, it paced around Harriet, motioning for her to put the staff/key into the pool.

The team had a quick discussion and seeing no other way to get out of the temple, Harriet put the bottom of the staff into the liquid. The cloudy liquid began to swirl and the become clearer, but darker. Finally she let go of the staff and it began to sink, slowly.

The caretaker was ecstatic, in glee. Shiluo was the first to notice that the greenish-stone walls were becoming translucent. All around them, suddenly they could see that they were indeed deep underwater, the only light coming from the shell of the temple, which was vanishing before their very eyes.

Suddenly there was a sound of rushing water. They could almost feel the ocean about to collapse on top of them. And then there was a bright light and they found themselves back in the ruins of the temple, surrounded by the mere. All that remained of their adventure was the pool, clear liquid with murky clouds swirling beneath the surface, where Harriet had dropped the key, was still in the corner of the ruins.

## Leaving the temple

There were two passages, one on each side of the ruins. There was the glade that they had come through and one on the other side.

They knew that there had been dangers waiting for them they way they had come. The visions that they saw in the pool suggested that there was a mysterious tree and an active graveyard on the other side.

Hours apparently had passed since they had gone into the temple, darkness was about to fall on the ruins. They had about 13 days to get to their rendezvous at West Harbor. The original plan had been to travel along the coast. 

>Consulting their map, they discussed the Uthtower, a landmark between where they came ashore and West Harbor. Like the temple ruins and the Illfarn ruins, the Uthtower was a relic of a time long passed. In fact, the Uthtower had a number of histories. Originally constructed during the reign of Uth. It fell with the kingdom, only to rise again as a stronghold for Chardansearavitriol, the black dragon. Later the tower was converted to a temple devoted to Myrkul, but it sunk into it's legendary catacombs. It rose a final time about 100 years ago, around the mysterious astronomical event, *the Eye of Myrkul*, it was visible for only during this strange syzygy, and then it sunk back into the mere. Today, there remains the ruins of what is believed to be the incarnation of the tower that dates back to the reign of Chardansearavitriol.

As darkness continued it's unassailable approach, they became more and more aware that there was something moving along the other route, the route to the tree. Both routes would lead to the shore and their path to West Harbor. But looking at the map, Shiluo had another idea.

His experience with maps and travel, he judged that if they could traverse the mere to the marked travel path and then to the High Road, they could make easier travel if they could get to the more established road. From there they could head to investigate the Illfarn ruins and then head to West Harbor.

## Being followed
A plan devised, they set off. Shiluo cut a path for the rest to follow, as the way through this less traveled area had more treacherous footing and a slower go than they had initially anticipated. They trekked until the darkness finally overtook the mere and Harriet used *Druidcraft* again to setup a suitable, defensive camp. It was while they were setting up camp that Irasav and Harriet noticed something along the path Shiluo had carved. Something following them.

They huddled quickly and came up with a new plan. Irasav cast [Pass without trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace), providing them a new level of concealment. To take advantage of it, Harriet and Irasav stole off and snuck into the brush, for all intents and purposes vanishing in the cover of the spell, leaving Shiluo and Remeele as bait in the center of their encampment. Shiluo and Remeele started a fire and made a much of a ruckus as they could. All the while, the entire lot of them continued to watch movement in the area around them. Whatever they were, they were very good at staying concealed in the mere.

Finally, Remeele was able to draw it out and in one smooth action Shiluo drew the Hellish Great Axe and launched fire towards the figure. Irasav stepped out of cover and unleashed his mighty breath weapon. Fire scorched the Yuan-ti Stalker, but it was undeterred. Irasav followed the attack with a dart to the creature.

Another Yuan-ti slid out of hiding to fire it's bow at Remeele, but had it slip from it's fingers. 

Shiluo fired another blast from the great axe. Remeele cast Vicious Mockery at the would-be archer. The first Yuan-ti charged Shiluo, moving across the treacherous terrain effortlessly, biting the sailor.

A third Yuan-ti Stalker popped out of it's cover firing a bow, missing Shiluo with two arrows. Irasav darted the yuan-ti engaged with Remeele. When suddenly a giant constrictor emerged from the small creek that they had been following. It sprung out and bit Irasav. The Yuan-ti who still had it's bow, tucked it away and lashed out at Irasav and then Rameele with a scimitar.

Shiluo turned his attention to the giant snake. Remeele attacked the constrictor with her own scimitars. Harriet flew into the fray cracking her whip across the snake, twisting it at the last second, capturing it's maw in her weapon's coil. 

Irasav returned blows with the Yuan-ti, unleashing a flurry of strikes, two shortsword attacks and four open-hand strikes. The Yuan-ti attempted to attack back, but was dazed and the blow glanced off the dragonborn. 

As the snake broke open it's mouth, breaking free from Harriet's whip that hand entangled it. A powerful move that left it vulnerable to Shiluo's Hellish Greataxe, cutting deep into it's throat, killing it dead.

Remeele sliced the Yuan-ti with her scimitars again cutting it down. Seeing the damage wrought by their *prey*(?) the first and only remaining Yuan-ti, retreated, running as fast as it could in the opposite direction.

## The strange gem
Meanwhile Harriet attempted to investigate the gem, prodding it with her whip. Suddenly a blast of light ripped through the mere. Remeele and Shiluo dropped to the ground. A shock ran through Irasav, freezing him in his tracks, but causing no damage. Harriet, was thrown back into the air and floated back 20 feet.

The blast healed Irasav's wounds, and also fortified his stamina. Shiluo felt the strange energy coursing through him, changing him. Painlessly he grew two feet taller, stronger. A bolt of lightning shot out and struck Remeele and she too grew two feet taller. Elevated above the ground Harriet convulsed, her heart stopping and then she gasp for air, then her heart stopped again for a moment and then her breathe escaped her and she could hear a cacophony  of voices calling her name and then suddenly falling silent.

## The High Road

Shaken, the team continued their trek to the High Road. Once they reached the road, Shiluo summoned a camel for him and Remeel. Irasav, who could move more swiftly, walked; while Harriet, of course, took to the wing. 

As the team started down the High Road towards the Carnath Roadhouse, on the horizon behind them, they noticed a lone Yuan-ti, battered and burned slide out of the mere and then quickly back into cover.
