## The Road to Carnath
The Diegesis team was on their way from the Temple of Ramenos to the Illefarn Portal Ruins. On their way they had planned to stop at the Carnath Roadhouse, but as they approached the Carnath Roadhouse they noticed that there was a phalanx of troops, clad mostly in platemail, flying a familiar banner, securing the area.

```Irasav: *One’s story is rarely advanced by hiding away from events*```

```Shiluo: *On land or sea, fortune favors the bold.*```

```Harriet was sure that if they explained to the authorities what’s going on everything will be fine.```

Almost unheard of, there was a blockade across the High Road in front of the entrance to the Carnath Roadhouse. Seven heavily armored swordsmen and three shield-bearers blocked the road. More soldiers could be seen at the actual front entrance to the Roadhouse. Along the walls, there were at least five archers peering down from their posts.

The sentry sergeant waved them down to stop before they reached them, far enough from *melee range* but definitely within range of their archers. Politely she requested that you state your business.

```Irasav: *We seek shelter and sustenance before continuing on our journey of discovery and meditation*```

They asked what their destination was and informed them that the Roadhouse was closed due to an emergency and suggest that they find somewhere safe to rest off the High Road. 

*A reminder, the Roadhouse is legendary, as it is open to all travelers and has a long reputation as a safe haven.*

Cautiously, Irasav told the armored sargeant that they were on their way to Waterdeep. The soldier was about to let them pass when Captain Windsorr and Andrew Brierhew, the *security chief* of Carnath Roadhouse, drew towards them. Windwsorr asked, "Is this the dragonborn?"

All of the Swordmen seemed to tense at this question. Brierhew looked Irasav over quickly, "No that' not Vold, that's not them."

Captain WIndsorr shook her head and dismissed the team, sending the Diegesis agents on their way.
