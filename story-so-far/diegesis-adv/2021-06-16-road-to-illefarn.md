## The Road to Carnath
The Diegesis team was on their way from the Temple of Ramenos to the Illefarn Portal Ruins. On their way they had planned to stop at the Carnath Roadhouse, but as they approached the Carnath Roadhouse they noticed that there was a phalanx of troops, clad mostly in platemail, flying a familiar banner, securing the area.

>Irasav: *One’s story is rarely advanced by hiding away from events*

>Shiluo: *On land or sea, fortune favors the bold.*

>Harriet was sure that if they explained to the authorities what’s going on everything will be fine.

Almost unheard of, there was a blockade across the High Road in front of the entrance to the Carnath Roadhouse. Seven heavily armored swordsmen and three shield-bearers blocked the road. More soldiers could be seen at the actual front entrance to the Roadhouse. Along the walls, there were at least five archers peering down from their posts.

The sentry sergeant waved them down to stop before they reached them, far enough from *melee range* but definitely within range of their archers. Politely she requested that you state your business.

>Irasav: *We seek shelter and sustenance before continuing on our journey of discovery and meditation*

They asked what their destination was and informed them that the Roadhouse was closed due to an emergency and suggest that they find somewhere safe to rest off the High Road. 

*A reminder, the Roadhouse is legendary, as it is open to all travelers and has a long reputation as a safe haven.*

Cautiously, Irasav told the armored sargeant that they were on their way to Waterdeep. The soldier was about to let them pass when Captain Windsorr and Andrew Brierhew, the *security chief* of Carnath Roadhouse, drew towards them. Windsorr asked, "Is this the dragonborn?"

All of the Swordmen seemed to tense at this question. Brierhew looked Irasav over quickly, "No that' not Vold, that's not them."

Captain Windsorr shook her head and dismissed the team, sending the Diegesis agents on their way.

## The High Road
The team moved away from the squad at Carnath Roadhouse as fast as they could and head south on the High Road. They moved quickly, to put distance between them and the Sword of Leilon and the Roadhouse, but moved cautiously, weary of the bandits on High Road.

The *"roads"* in the Mere weren't marked and weren't always reliable. Between the four of them they found the path that lead back towards the Illefarn ruins fairly easily.

## The Illefarn Ruins 
What the team knew about Illefarn Portal Ruins
>Illefarn, also known as Fallen Kingdom, was a great elven kingdom located along the northern Sword Coast between the Western Heartlands and the North, with populace consisting mostly of elves and dwarves.
>
>The Illefarn kingdom fell, more out of attrition and the growth of the other empires around them, than any conflict outright. While it is commonly believed that the advancement of humans in the area lead to the elves retreating from Ilelfarn to Evermeet and even razing their shining capital, Aelinthaldaar in -1100 DR. Aelinthaldaar, which once stood in the shadow of Waterdeep mountain, where the modern *Shinning City* stands today.
>
>Illefarn possessed numerous portals, most of which were teleportation devices to other places of Toril and not gates to other planes. Some were used for artistic purposes: portal stones were activated by a specific song, which transported the singer along the chain of portals called a songpath in rhythm with the song. Most songpaths were deactivated during the fall of empire, long before the fall Aelinthaldaar.
>
>In modern times, the records of the Diegesis tell that the ruins sit upon a mesa, a permanent raised plateau, that stood solid in the the otherwise sludge of the mere. It has been widely speculated that the mesa isn't a natural formation, but a construct of the Illefarn engineers, though no investigations have lead to any actual evidence of the mesa's origin, for all intents and purposes it appears to be a natural formation. The ruins themselves are little more than shells of the ancient towers, which are believed to be over 22,000 years old. In centuries of investigations, there has been no trace of any residual magic or life in these legendary ruins.

## Encampment at the mesa

As they moved off the High Road and back into the Mere, Shiluo dismissed the camel and summoned a creature that would be more appropriate for a swamp. He wasn't sure what he expected but it certainly wasn't a giant eight-legged corgi. The creature's huge paws and extra legs made it's passage through the swamp surprisingly easy.

As she flew ahead, scouting the path, Harriet was the first of them to see the mesa and the ruins. She flew back and let the rest of the team know the distance, the road ahead and that there was a small encampment of creatures set-up at the base of the mesa.

Keeping a safe distance, she couldn't tell exactly what kind of creatures there were, but she could see a small handful of them moving around the camp and about a dozen or more bodies strewn about the area. 

The team used stealth to approach the camp and get a better look. There were three gnolls and two quasits and a large *demonic* centaur-like creature. Irasav and Harriet recognize the creature as *Armanite*, a tanar'ri demon from the Abyss, who were known as *calvary troop* or even mercenary creatures in the abyssmal realms.

```Gnolls: 3, Quasits: 2, Armanite: 1```


![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/armanite.png?raw=true) Armanite

Quickly a plan was hatched, using the same opening salvo as they used in the glades, Remeele cast [hypnotic pattern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hypnotic-pattern) at the encampment. This time, only two of the creatures fell under her spell, one of the gnolls and one of the quasits.

```Gnolls: 2(1), Quasits: 1(1), Armanite: 1```

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/quasit-sm.png?raw=true) Quasit

Irasav stepped out of cover and unleashed a flurry of blows, demolishing one of the quasits.  Harriet and Irasav saw something dark and foreboding moving around the battlefield, right before the armanite attacked. Shiluo managed to dodge the hooves, but the creature's serrated tail slashed out, cutting into him.

One of the gnolls advanced on Irasav, who lashed out striking the creature before it could get off an attack. Shiluo pulled out the **Shard of Lyryaan**, his small, but mighty hammer, and crashed it into the armanite and unleashing the **Wrath of the Sea**, channeling it's energy from the mere around them.

Slobnir, the giant corgi, slammed into the battle biting the armanite. When suddenly the very shadows came alive as a shadow attacked Shiluo.

```Gnolls: 2(1), Quasits: 0(1), Armanite: 1, Shadow!!!: 1```

The gnoll lunged at Irasav with his spear, slicing into him. Harriet flew around and unleashed her Quilinbian Whip, slashing through the shadow, trying to ensnare it, but it slipped through the whip. Irasav cast [sacred flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sacred-flame) torching the gnoll. Harriet circled back and threw her three-bladed flechette into the shadow, which seemed almost impervious to that attack as well.

Remeele cast [vicious mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vicious-mockery) on the armanite, causing to reel back in agony, as the psychic attack bit into it's mind. Enraged, the armanite crashed into Shiluo with it's hooves and tried to spear Harriet out of the sky with it's serrated tail. Still furious, it lashed out and lightning sprung from it's fingers and struck Remeele.

A second shadow attacked Irasav, who again managed to sidestep the attack. He spun and cast [Word of Radiance](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/word-of-radiance) on two of the gnolls and the shadow that had just attacked him, finishing off by landing five staggering blows on one of the gnolls.

```Gnolls: 1(1), Quasits: 0, Armanite: 1, Shadows: 2!!!```

Shiluo, rallied by the devastating series of attacks from the armanite and the equally impressive assault by Irasav, focused all of his energy that he could muster and attacked with the Shard of Lyryaan. He crashed the small hammer into the giant armanite and it sent a powerful shockwave through the creature as the Wrath of the Sea burst forth from the weapon, as it cracked open the monster's chest a burst of swamp water exploded from the dying demon. Without missing a beat, he turned and unleashed the same fate to the gnoll fighting with Irasav. 

```Gnolls: 0(1), Quasits: 0, Armanite: 0, Shadows: 2```

Irasav and Remeele whittled down the horrific shadows, dispatching one. Leaving the last to fall victim to Shiluo's small hammer.

```Gnolls: 0(1), Quasits: 0, Armanite: 0, Shadows: 0```

Finally, the encampment was cleared, except for one gnoll, still entranced by Remeele's hypnotic lights. She and Shiluo kept watch over the enfeebled creature while Irasav and Harriet looked around the camp.

The encampment had fortified defenses and looked as if it had been there for awhile. There were dozens of crates and boxes, from the looks of it - it was the hijacked loot from High Road robberies. Most of it was broken and misused at this point. There was also a litter of bodies: a dozen or so bullywugs, four or five Yuan-ti, two batrachi, several more gnolls, a handful of quasits and two armanite corpses. Obviously a pitched battle occurred place here, and it seemed like they just cleaned up what was left of victors.

Finally, the team turned to the remaining gnoll. Remeele cast [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person) on the hapless gnoll and began to question it.

**What was going on here?**
>We came through your portal, fleshy pig, and killed all your friends.

**Where did you come from?**
>The portal! Fool! Our hunting team was hiding in the Seeping Woods waiting for fleshy-things or demon trespassers. When your portal opened and we came through and killed your friends. (cackling)

**Where was this portal?**
>It was your portal, orc-vomit, it was where you left it! (It pointed up towards the ruins)

Once they were certain that there was little more that the could get from the creature, Remeele released it from her spell and they dispatched it.
```gnolls: 0```

## The Illefarn Portal Ruins

At the top of the mesa they found the remnants of three great towers. But really only one of them still bore any resemblance to the shape of these once prominent structures. Almost at the edge of the mesa, a circle of stone and ruins in concentric circles ringed a very familiar looking pool.Almost at the edge of the mesa, a circle of stone and ruins in concentric circles ringed a very familiar looking pool. Beautiful white stones, stood in sharp contrast to the mere. 

Even the stone circle that formed the pool was the same luminescent dark green and the liquid in the pool was also clear, but filled with a white-cloudy substance that moved slowly beneath the surface, just like in the Temple of Ramenos.

And just outside of the rings was an stone arch-shaped doorway. The stones, alabaster, different than stones of the rest of the ruins. An arch identical to the doorway that still stood at Temple.

Peering through the archway, for the first time in over a thousand years, a doorway opened to...
