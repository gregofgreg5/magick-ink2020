# The Temple of Ramenos
## Prologue

### Einric
Einric was a renown Diegesis scholar who became a legendary adept. The long-lived elf, spent over five hundred years building a career exploring and adventuring up and down the Sword Coast. The Diegesis already had eight Books of Einric when he disappeared. And there were dozens of other Books from adepts who encountered him in their journeys and even a few who shared adventures with him.

His work informed a legion of scholars and gave rise to hundreds of lines of research across the Colleges. His disappearance rocked the Academy. Einric and Tal, his most recent apprentice, had been exploring landmarks in the Mere of Deadmen for almost a hundred years.

It wasn't uncommon for the two of them to be gone for months, but when Einric missed a long-scheduled meeting with the First Curator of College of Westgate. The two had been lifelong friends and over the centuries they always prioritized their meetings. When he missed the appointment, the Academy began to fear the worst. The Curator sent a team to Waterdeep and a quick investigation of their domiciles turned up a couple of Tal's journals, but not Einric's. Like most adepts, Einric and Tal journaled their chronicles, notes for when they are ready to write their Book.

Part of Tal's training was to learn the *master's ways.* There was a lot of reflection and Tal's insight into what she thought they doing and what Einric was working on. Sometimes they worked as a team, partners. Often she followed his lead, as they undertook one adventure after another. Sometimes he would let her lead and would use that time to help shape her own methods.

She was excited, in her last series of entries they had been researching a handful of archaic legends and relics in the Mere: ancient temples to be exact. Between the lizardfolk, dragon lairs and whatnot there were dozens of *hot spots* to consider. Cryptic, Tal was certain that Einric thought that they had found some long, lost reliquary, sanctuary or tomb, something important. Something very, very hidden.

They were part of a team of adventurers who had been together for almost five years. They had been very successfuol, having already unearthed a priceless relic from the Age of the Black Dragon from the Mere and now, from all indication, they were on to something bigger.

And then they were gone. Over a year went by and no one heard hide nor hair of any of them. Least of all Tal or Einric. That was 70 years ago.

## Eklas Kisri
About a year ago an adept in Leilon reported to the Academy that she believed that she had recovered equipment that may have belonged to an adept and he continued to scour the area and eventually found three tomes hidden a cave, concealed, buried in a wall: Einric's last journals. In them, she recounted that the two legendary adepts had indeed found something astonishing.

A veteran adept, Eklas Kisri and two couriers were dispatched at once to retrieve the tomes. Shortly after they took possession of the tomes, trouble began along the High Road between Leilon and Waterdeep, where they were expected to book passage on a ship back to Westgate. However, not wanting to risk the raiders, and being experienced travelers in the Mere, Kisri felt the safer choice would be to travel off of the beaten path. 

As word grew that travel along the High Road was getting more dangerous, Kisri decided to forgo their plans to depart from Waterdeep and make for the closer port at West Harbor. It was en route to West Harbor that they were ambushed. One of the couriers was slain. Kisri and the other barely escaped with their lives, but they had lost the precious tomes.

### Harriet
Before being assigned to *journal work*, Harriet, a scholar at the College of Westgate, was on a detail examining artifacts and relics recovered along the Sword Coast. There were, over the course of centuries, quite a few items, some of archeological interest and some less mundane. All of the items that came into the Academy had some significance. Either of their own history or because of where they were found. For the most part during this assignment she spent her time helping to determine if items were magic and their school of magic, if not their actual powers. Much of the true divination was left to the more experienced scholars, while she worked primarily on identifying schools of magic.

While studying the relics was interesting - especially working with the elder scholars, she was happy to be given the opportunity to pour through some journals. Not all adepts and scholars turn in their journals, as most see them as private notes or the *work in progress*. But many do, and of course there are those whose journals pass into the hands of the Academy posthumously, never having the chance to complete their own work.

Journal work was the task of reviewing and making notes from the *work in progress* to compare those to those notes of other scholars and sometimes even to the completed Books. *Always looking for connections*, adding more eyes that might see a different detail, different connection or connections to things that other viewers may not have any experience to see.

A wizard by training, journal work wasn't her favorite task, but it wasn't her least favorite either. An aarakocra, she knew that she couldn't expect the long lifespan of an elf or even a gnome. With that in mind, some might think that spending her time reading about other people's lives would feel like a waste, but not Harriet. She enjoyed reading the journals, the rawness of them made her feel like she was experiencing the author's lives more vividly than the polished and carefully crafted Books. If she wasn't going to have the dozens of lifetimes that some of her colleagues would enjoy, she could cram as many lifetimes as she could into the relatively short one that she would have.

The very reason that the Academy has their brilliant scholars and college-housed adepts work in research is, of course, to force the readers to see connections where they might otherwise not be obvious. To put active minds in places where they might not otherwise be. For example, a sketch that Harriet found in Tal's journal matched a symbol, or *part of a symbol* that she had been looking at on an archaic, petrified staff that was recovered from the Mere decades ago. The staff was part of a treasure horde from a long-abandoned subterranean outpost of a Black Dragon cult, presumably from the Age of Dragons.

Scholars had determined that the staff was once powerful, but appeared to have long since expended it's magic. Even residual traces of it's purpose or uses were mostly gone, only that it was once used for *divination* was left to be divined. It was categorized as a *morbund relic*, no longer of use, but perhaps something that was once important historically, to the Narrative. 

The experts had determined that it had it's origins in the Mere. And because of it's simplicity, it's lack of apparent purpose or even fashion, that it was unlikely to have belonged to the Dragon Cult. They could not even imagine a plausible use for it in the hands of lizardfolk, unless it was some kind shamanic tool. It was ruled out as being shamanic by it's lack of detailing or ornament. In fact the only distinguishing features that were still visible to either mundane or magical eye were a few, slight and inobvious carvings. Almost more random scratches than intentional carvings, only their briefly repeated pattern suggested that they held any significance. Harriet spent a week staring at them, researching them, re-drawing them, trying to make something out of them, but alas, filed her musings with the rest of the notes that would accompany the relic.

If not the dragons or lizardfolk, the staff's origin pointed to one of the other long-time consistent resident of the Mere, bullywugs. But the wugs had been observed to be less organized, with a distinct lack of social or cultural, communal development characterized their nomadic groupings. The most obvious permanent, non-transient, remnant of any wug *society* was the loose connection to the ruins of the Temple of Ramenos. Ramenos was a grotesque deity whose time in the Mere waned at the dawn of the Dragon Age. Little was known about the workings of, the goings on, in the Temple of Ramenos, when it was active. To the Academy's knowledge there were no writings from the era, no oral history that anyone knew of, only the legends that the bullywugs were part of the order whom worshiped the deity, who was best characterized by it's horribleness, in form and function.

It was in the margins of a note about the Temple of Ramenos that Harriet had found a crude sketch, a doodle or a scribble almost. A scribble that was similar, very similar to some of markings on the petrified staff that she had so recently been studying. Different, for sure, but similar. Similar enough to make the connection. 

Given the connection that she discovered, Harriet was asked to go investigate the ruins of *the Temple of Ramenos*, in the Mere of Deadmen. An adept with her share of experience in the world outside of the College, she seemed the perfect person to undertake this journey. As fate would have it, the merchant ship *Admiral's Yalmen* was in port at Westgate and available to make a run up the Sword Coast. Conveniently there were also three other experienced adepts already on board. Many adepts who choose an untethered life find their way to the sea. In this case there was a long-trusted, savvy, sea-hardened sailor-cavalier; a wily bard who always seemed to be one step away from heading to her next adventure; and a brother monk, who had spent most of his career as a *hired man* and sometimes even a *sellsword*, peeling back the layers of the Narrative from adventure to adventure.

Four seasoned adepts did indeed seem like overkill for this particular mission, to investigate a trail that had gone cold almost half a century earlier. But there was a significant gravity to anything that had anything to do with Einric, especially since it involved traveling into the wilds of the Mere.
