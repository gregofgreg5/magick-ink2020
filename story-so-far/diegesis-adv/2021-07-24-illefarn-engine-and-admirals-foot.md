# Battle at the Illefarn Engine

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/illefarn-portals-sm.jpg?raw=true)

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, one of the elf centurians struck Remeele down with his spear and she was on the brink of death for the second time in less than an hour.

Galungorm and one of the centurians who wielded a flaming scimitar took on Irasav. While Cyan'dar wielded a sickle and had taken on Shiluo. Shiluo, at 7'6" cut an impressive figure and made for a tempting target. The elf warrior with the was also drawn to the corsair. 

Remeele, who had managed to recover enough to get into the melee and saw that her attacker was already defeated so she joined Harriet attacking the scimitar elf, who was closet to them. Harriet with her Quilinbian whip and Remeele with her own scimitars, felling the elf. But when the *elf* dropped, it transformed... changed into a yuan-ti!

Harriet turned her whip on the *elf* with the double-crossbow, but he was able to dodge the strike. Remeele, whose recovery left her in a body 14 years old, but still on the tall size, turned her scimitars on Galungorm. 

Cyan'dar spoke an elvish word and her sickle split into two weapons a scimitar and a scythe, but Shiluo smashed her with his hammer. When Cyan'dar fell she also transformed, changing to the grotesque form of a batrachi! He turned a slammed the hammer into the spear and shield centurian, unleashing the fury of storms, crushing him. Another yuan-ti.

Seeing the tide turn, the elf/yuan-ti with the double-crossbow ran and escaped through one of the portals. Remeele struck down the yuan-ti with the flaming scimitar.

Galungorm, the only foe remaining, fought to his last breath, which Irasav deftly beat out of him. He fell, revealing another batrachi.

On their *persons*, each batrachi carried a wooden object shaped like a large key burdened with geometric shapes. Harriet & Irasav pocketed one each.

## The Illefarn Engine

Battered, bloodied, bruised and a little dead, they all needed their rest so they hunkered down, took turns guarding the entrance. 

They also had time to put together some pieces. Bullywugs were under the command of the batrachi in front of the ruins at Ramenos. There was the seemingly unrelated yuan-ti stalking squad that followed them across the mere. There were wugs, batrachi and yuan-ti among the carnage in the camp at the base of the Illefarn ruins. And now here, in the Illefarn engine: yuan-ti warriors supporting two more batrachi.

Harriet reminded the team that the original diegesis team: Einrich and Tal had been investigating something happening at multiple sites in the mere. From the records that the Academy had, they had been found something in some ancient temple. Or other landmark ruin.

Rested, they began to explore the portals, doorway and window that were around the chamber.
 
### The Window

Irasav inspected the large window at the top of the stairs. The window had what appeared to be an iron carving of a strange tree covering it. Behind the iron frame there was a cascade of colors, moving serenely. The colors were soft and subdued, nothing like the spasmatic, bright, and almost electric colors that filled the ceiling. That was all the dragonborn could tell from a few steps down below the window.

### Ruins of the Temple of Ramenos
![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/temple-of-ramenos-after.jpg?raw=true)

As Rameele found out, the ruins were exactly as she remembered them. Complete with the strange pool of liquid that matched the *fuel* for the engine. The fuel that she touched and it nearly killed her.

The arch she passed through was identical to the one that they came through in the ruins of the Illefarn portals to get to the engine.

But it was still (*apparently*) in the mere, no longer underwater.

### The other portal
While everyone took turns looking through or at the portals, Harriet spent the most time looking through the portal that the elf/yuan-ti had escaped through.

It was a forrested area and in the distance there was a another set of ruins. There was something familiar about the ruins, but she couldn't quite put figure out what it was or where she knew it from. Researching ruins and artifacts in the mere had been her job for the beter part of the past year, until she was assigned to chase down the clues that she uncovered. Which led her and this team here.

There was something here, through this portal, but she wasn't sure exactly what it was. 

In the portal she could see large shadows, shapes moving in the distance. Maybe some blocking out the light above.

The others looked through and saw the forest, in the darkness. And planned for what they believed was the inevitable *welcome party* that the elf/yuan-ti had rushed to for succor. 

### The wooden door.
A wooden door was built into the stone and ceramic frame.

After they had rested and were recovered, Remeele pushed the door open. Carefully she moved through the door.

## The room without a door, except for you know, the door

On the other side of the door, Remeele found a circular chamber with a stone floor. The walls were made of wood, but a different wood than the door. And there were no other visible exits or entrances in the chamber.

She looked back through and saw her companions, so she stepped back through. Upon Irasav's recommendation she stepped back through the door and closed it. She pulled it open and saw the team looking back. She closed it again and pushed it open and revealed a hallway.

The rest of the team joined her. The brought the dead yuan-ti and batrachi into the circular room and then went back through the door into the corridor.

## The outer ring
The hallway wrapped around the chamber. The walls, like the floor were made of stone. There didn't initially appear to be way back into the inner chamber. Careful inspection revealed a secret passage that allowed Irasav and Shiluo to pass back into the room with the door. But Harriet and Remeele could only pass through if they went with either the dragonborn or the corsair.

On the other end of the secret door, they found another door on the wall opposite of the chamber with the mysterious door leading to the Illefarn engine.

This door, wooden, like the other, was locked. Before they could try to work the locking mechanism or simply smash through it, they heard a low growl seemingly surrounding them.

## Who left the dogs out?
As they huddled around the door, investigating, they became aware of a of a low growling sound coming from both sides of the hallway around them.

They turned to see two creatures shaped like men, tall, muscular and wiry, standing over seven feet tall each. Long arms covered in coarse lupine fur and ending in giant, razor sharp claws, both of them carrying glaives. Their heads were like wolves with intimidating teeth, their yellow eyes gleaming in the poorly lit hall. A third wolf creature moved in from the corridor on the left.

Remeele cast [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person) on the one closest to her, ordering it to stand down. The other creature lunged and sliced into Shiluo with his glaive, it turned again and slammed the back of the back of the polearm into Shiluo's shoulder, trying to hit a nerve cluster.

Shiluo unleashed the Shard of Lyryaan, the small, almost ornamental hammer swung through the air, smashing into the creature twice, staggering it and knocking it back, knocking the wind out of it.

Irasav moved like a dancer, swinging the Sword of Galungorm slicing into the creature. Throwing a knife hand towards it's throat, glancing off it's hide as it turned away from the attack. Harriet advanced with the *hoplite's doru* spear, catching the creature in the side, pushing it through the monster's chest, killing it.

Shiluo swung a backhand strike on the creature, missing as the monster dodged, but it wasn't fast enough to avoid his second strike, the blow struck the creature square across the jaw with a loud explosion, blasting the creature's head clean open.

Two of the three monsters dispatched and the third under Remeele's *charms*, she ordered it to open the door revealing a short walkway that lead to a staircase heading down. More interesting though, was that the walkway was suspended across a short chasm. It appeared that this entire circular floor was suspended *somehow* above what looked like the same brilliant, flashing explosion of colorful lights that they had seen in the mere on the giant snake and on the ceiling of the Illefarn engine. Striking absent though was the horrific sounds that had accompanied the other appearances. From their vantage point it looked like they were about 50-70 feet above the floor below.

A discussion ensued about what to do with the wolf-creature. Some suggested that they test the light show by tossing their prisoner into it. However, it was decided to see if they could come up with a better use for it. and started down the stairs and into the morning light.


## The Admiral's Foot
Carefully they moved out into light. The found themselves on the top walkway of a fort. They didn't see anyone else on this level, but did see a handful of soldiers in platemail and what looked like guards or troops moving around the courtyard below. They quickly ducked down behind the half-wall to avoid being seen. Experienced adventurers, the scents in the air suggested that they were still in the Mere. Shiluo looked around and was certain that he recognized this particular fort.

>**The Admiral's Foot** or sometimes *The Admiral's Boot*. Admiral Jessup Drybeard was a fearsome corsair who commanded the ships that first established landed in the mere. Drybeard and his men built the for that was intended to be the staging ground for settling the part of the Sword Coast. After establishing, what would become, West Harbor, they used this fort as security for the fledgling settlement.
>
>Over the years the fort has mostly fallen out of official use. It was sometimes used for large festivals or celebrations and housed the halfling militia and had a small jail. Widely it was renown for it's historical relevance.

There was a discussion about climbing down on either side of the walkway. They could go down into the courtyard and try to make it to the stables, but there were an awful lot of guards and soldiers that way. They could try to go down outside the fort and make it West Harbor, which was closer now than they had been before.

But the adventurer's heart and the desire to find out more about what was going on here won out. They decided at the very least to check out the small structure on this level, on the other side of the fort.

Irasav cast [pass without trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace) to conceal their movement and they moved carefully around the upper walkway to the building. They listened at the door and could hear at least three voices, gruff and deep, guttural even. 

A plan was hatched and Remeele asked the wolf creature to open the door and enter. To their surprise the voices inside sounded surprised to see it. They even sounded surprised that it was real.

Remeele moved in taking quick stock of the room. There were four half-orcs. Two of them were much larger than the other two. She motioned and cast her signature move, [hypnotic pattern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hypnotic-pattern) in the center of the room.

Three of the guards fell under her spell, frozen in place. Irasav moved in with the Sword of Galungorm and cut down the last half-orc who hadn't fallen under the effects of the spell.

There were two catapults and two cast-iron vats of red sand, over burning coals, poised to be dumped on would-be invaders. In the opposite corner of the room was a stack of hay bales and a large barrel of some kind of obviously flammable goop. 

As they were taking inventory of the area, another large half-orc came up a set of stairs right next to the door. It swung it's great axe at Remeele but missed. Enraged, it reached into it's belt pouch and threw a small projectile at Remeele. She deftly stepped back avoiding it, but as it hit the ground it exploded, bursting with a thundering clap and a large billow of smoke.

Across the courtyard, the heightened sense of hearing of a seemingly innocuous swarm of insects took notice. **Erethil Naïlo**, one of the Tavernlords from Waterdeep, who had wild shaped into a swarm of insects, waiting for an opportunity to aid his friends who had been taken prisoner under the fort, saw the young, teenage-looking Remeele step back, covering in defense from the small bomb and the half-orc coming after her. He flew as fast as he could to the other side of the fort to render assistance.

Below them, in the stables, the kobold **Taklak** who had recently attached himself and his *mount* **Stupid**, the giant weasel, to the Tavernlords, was also biding their time, looking for a chance to free the mighty Vold, the dragonborn and the rest of his friends. Or at least Vold. Plotting his intricate plan to get into the prison, Taklak didn't notice the explosion, but Stupid did and got it's *master's* attention. Finally hearing the commotion, the two of them began to *sneak* (which was not their forté) towards the stairs that would lead them to where the explosion had occurred.

Remeele's *Master's Scimitar* cut into the third half-orc guard, staggering it back towards Irasav. With a savage glee the dragonborn monk unleashed the Sword of Galungorm again, ramming the flaming sword into the half-orc's back and through his chest. Remeele winced at the carnage, more surprised by the explosion of blood than repulsed.

Erethil wild-shaped back into his native elfin form and introduced himself and offered his assistance. Arrows whizzed by the two of them as an archer in plate advanced from the stairwell. Erethil recognized the Sword of Leilon's coat of arms on the archer.

Harriet, seeing Remeele and Irasav react to the archer flew over the short wall and peered down the stairwell, where she could see the two Sword guards: an archer and swordsman approaching. She spread her wings and cast [flaming sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere), dropping a ball of fire down into the stairway at the Sword. Harriet followed that up by sweeping down into the stairwell and running him through with her new spear, killing him instantly. He fell backwards and began boiling in his armor before he exploded.

Meanwhile, Shiluo began clearing out the hypnotized guards, one by one crashing them down with the Shard of Lyryaan. He slammed the first guard in the chest, crushing it in. He spun, rushing the last guard and drove the hammer into forehead, cratering it.

Erethil warned Remeele and shifted into Bugbear form, ducking into the room. Seeing a ball of fire between him, the intruders... and a bugbear, the Sword of Leilon swordsman ran back down the stairs.

While Erethil (now an elf again) and Harriet (still a beautiful toucan aarakocra) watched the Sword escape, Remeele shifted her attention to the materials at hand and had her charmed wolf-monster start applying the flammable muck on the hay bales and tossing them out to the front of the gates.

In the stairwell, the Sword of Leilon ran into a pint-sized buzzsaw of destruction and his pet giant weasel. The others heard a veritable explosion of violence and then what sounded like an entire armory falling down the stairs. 

Shaking his head in disbelief, Irasav gazed down the stairwell and saw the tiny kobold,in what looked like kitchenware cobbled into armor and a giant weasel staring back at him in admiration.

""*Drraaagggonnnn*" Taklak looked up and grinned.
