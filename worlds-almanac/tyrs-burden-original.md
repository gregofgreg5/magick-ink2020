**Tyr's Burden** was a very small hamlet that started with a handful of pioneers looking to start anew on the brave frontier. With dreams of creating a farming community, to do Tyr's work, they moved west. The founders of Tyr's Burden of them came from the outskirts of a town called ***Morinden***, which had become increasingly oppressive over the past few years. The lord of Morinden had steadily increased taxes on their produce and had even begun to tax the church.
