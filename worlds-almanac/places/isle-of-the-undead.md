Off the coast of (*B-SE*) is the ***Isle of the Damned***, where every variety of undead imaginable can be found. From the most docile zombie or ghost to the ever dangerous liches and vampires, you can find them all here. A strange, hideous, familiar hierarchy of service and community exists here, where the powerful rule over the lowly. And there are plenty of lowly, who wander this island and sometimes try to make their way to the mainland… where they can feed.

On the Isle of the Damned there are pockets of amination, where a more powerful force has created and rules over a small domain.

To keep the denizens of the Isle in check, **Summerland,** ***the Silver Flame from the Citadel of Light***, *a unique cadre of freewill undead* do their best to keep the rest of the factions from trying to leave the island. Undead in their own right, the Silver Flame are sentient, if not completely of their living facilities, they have found their freedom from Orcus’ dominion. Allied with the actual Summerland, the Citadel of Light, their sole purpose is to fight back any efforts of the Undead Lords of this island, or the wandering undead, from reaching the mainland.

The history of the Isle is steeped in mystery. No one quite knows when or how the undead came to dominate the land. Or how they seem to continuously increase in number. The island itself is warmer, by far, than they should be.

**Summerland**, which was once a simple defensive outpost has become a legitimate city in it’s own right. Legend, rumor and holy word, have become more definitive of Summerland than any census. *The Citadel of Light, The Silver Flame*. On one hand, it is a small humble port city that sees very, very humble seaward traffic. On the other hand, it is a community that has been built up around the military base, where truth be told, more commerce comes from inland than the port, as few ships dare the straight between the Isle of the Damned.
