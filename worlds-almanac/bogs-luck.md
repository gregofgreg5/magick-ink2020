### Bog's Luck
*A dice game*
___
- **Number of players:** Minimum of two players
- **Materials:** Two die per player

### Rules

The game is played in three rounds.The highest roller is eliminated at the end of each round. Players must make at least one bet per round to continue, or fold (withdraw) from the game.

**Round One**

The game usually starts with an ante, where each player buys into the pot (*bog*). Then **before** anyone rolls dice players buy in with three betting units (e.g., a copper piece) and can make any one of two bets:

 * Players can bet on who will have the lowest roll. **wins 1 units**
 * Players can bet on what their roll will be. **wins 2 units**

If multiple players win the _lowest roll_, that bet does not pay out and the bog rolls over to the next round.

**Round Two**

To start round two, all players who can and want to continue bet three betting units and can make one of three bets:

 * Players bet on who will have the lowest roll **wins 1 units**
 * Players bet on what their roll will be **wins 2 units**
 * Players bet on the cumulative total of all rolls (from round 1 and 2) **wins 3 units**  

If multiple players win the _lowest roll or the cumulative roll_, that bet does not pay out and the bog rolls over to the next round.

**Round Three**

To start round three, all players who can and want to continue bet three betting units and can make one of three bets:

 * Players bet on who will have the lowest roll. **wins 2 units**
 * Players bet on what their roll will be **wins 4 units**
 * Players bet on the cumulative total of all rolls (from round 1, 2 & 3) **closest bet wins the bog**
 
 **As always** the highest roller gets eliminated. If there is a tie for *cumulative total*, all other players are eliminated and the players remaining roll to see who is lowest. Rolls continue unil there is a winner.
