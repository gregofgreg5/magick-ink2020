# Isle of the Damed

Off the coast of (*B-SE*) is the ***Isle of the Damned***, where every variety of undead imaginable can be found. From the most docile zombie or ghost to the ever dangerous lich and vampire. You can find them all here. A strange, hideous, familiar hierarchy of service and community exists here, where the powerful rule over the lowly. And there are plenty of lowly, who wander this island and sometimes try to make their way to the mainland… where they can feed.

On the Isle of the Damned there is a small pocket of animation, where a more powerful force has created and rules over a miniscule domain that no living soul has ever seen. It is a dark and inhuman place. It is small: a building, maybe a temple, and a few smaller contructs where a few handfuls of unimaginable creatures dwell among the undead. Small, almost unthreatenting. *Almost*. 

To keep the denizens of the Isle in check, **Summerland,** has sent ***the Silver Flame of the Citadel of Light***, *a unique cadre of freewill undead* to do their best to keep the rest of the factions of the unliving from trying to leave the island. Undead in their own right, the Silver Flame are sentient and have found their freedom from Orcus’ dominion. Their allegiance is to Summerland, the Citadel of Light, it is their manafest purpose: to fight back any efforts of the Undead Lords of the island, or the wandering undead, from reaching the mainland. And at all costs, they avoid that small manifest pocket. Whether it is because it threatens their *sentience* on a primal lever or it is simply plain fear, no one can (or will) say. Regardless, they confront their mission closer to the shore, far from that *strange pocket*.

The history of the Isle is steeped in mystery. No one quite knows when or how the undead came to dominate the land, or how they seem to continuously increase in number. The island itself is warmer, by far, than they should be. A feature most just don't think about to be honest.

**Summerland**, which was once a simple defensive outpost has become a legitimate city in it’s own right. Legend, rumor and holy word, have become more definitive of Summerland than any census. *The Citadel of Light*. On one hand, it is a small humble port city that sees very, very humble seaward traffic. Where more commerce comes from inland than the port it, is a community that has been built up around the military base, whose *soul* purpose is to hold off the undead.

*There legitimately are every imaginable form of undead on the island. They are in the complete service, of their lord Orcus, who continues to feed undead onto this island. While **Summerland** makes every effort to keep the undead from breaching the shore, they are blissfully unaware that there are tunnels that lead to/from the island to hundreds of passages all around the world. For the most part, surprisingly, the tunnels draw undead **from** the greater world. Still there are some, more ambitious denizens of the Isle that use the tunnels to make there presence felt on the *real world*.*

# The Other Undead

The *Isle of the Damned* is not the only source of undead in the world. As anywhere else in the *multiverse* undead spawn as they would all around the world. The one distinction, outside of the *Isle* is that there is a hidden *undead sanctuary*, a legendary mountain where some of the lower undead hide and some of the greater undead make their fortified keeps. Hidden somehwere out amongst the world, away from the *Isle of the Damned*, this strange geographic artifiact is both a treasure and the thing of nightmares. It has spawned those whom would hunt it for it's very existance and those who are terrified that it is really a place in their world.

While no one knows where it is, which indeed throws all accounts into question, it is said that undead from all over the world flock here, if they are not drawn to a more personal place amongst the living.

Aside from the *Isle* and the mysterious santuary, there is a third variety of *undead* that walk the land. These are known as **freewill undead**, those who have either retained some, seldom all, of their former sentience or have, at the bare miniumum, broken free from the *hunger* and the *thrall* of the **dark lord Orcus** and are learning to *live again*. Freewill undead can be of any *type*, but tend to be of the *less terrifying* variety, as the liches and vampires appear to draw more power directly from darker places. Sometimes, seemingly *almost human*, the Freewill undead might even find that they can find a new existance in society, though they are still more outcast and moster than *people* in most circles.

The Freewill undead, like all others, are found all over the world, but tend to be drawn to places of greater magic, where the *unsual* has a much broader range of acceptance.
