Teamwork Feats
Teamwork feats are feats that the whole party gets at once. This feat is granted to all members of the team, current and future. Parties with teamwork feats are hereafter referred to as "teams." Teams tend to only include player characters and any bonded creatures/NPCs (such as familiars) and not random NPCs or incidental allies. There must be at least two members of the team active in combat in order to use these feats.

## Team Initiative:
Your party have learned to intuitively cooperate during battle. This feat allows the party to act on the same turn, using the same initiative slot. Movement and actions may be discussed and executed in any order within that initiative slot. Members can choose to act outside of their team's turn if they wish, either by readying an action, or by rolling their own initiative. Players may leave or rejoin the team initiative at any time, so long as they do not gain any extra actions or get their turn sooner.
In addition, the party gets +2 to their team initiative check.
Variant: If team initiative is already used prior to taking this feat, instead apply a bonus of +4 to the team initiative check.

## Superior Coordination:
Your team knows how to work together to gain the advantage. When you perform a help action in battle as a bonus action, so long as the beneficiary of that action is a teammate.

## Pas de Deux:
Your team has become adept at maneuvering around each other in combat. As a bonus action, you may swap places with a willing adjacent teammate. Teammates may also invoke this feat as a reaction when an adjacent teammate is targeted by an enemy attack or area of effect. Upon swapping positions, the two also swap who is targeted. This ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Pass Item:
Your team is better coordinated, and quickly pass needed items between themselves. This feat requires two parties: the passer and the receiver. This ability allows the passer to take an item out of their inventory and pass it to a team member with whom they share line of sight and is within 30ft. This feat may be invoked two different ways:
 * The passer invokes this feat as a bonus action, throwing the item to the receiver who may spend their reaction to catch it, or let it fall on the ground within five feet of them.
 * Or the receiving character may call for a needed item as a free action, prompting the passing character to throw it as a reaction. The receiving character may catch it as a bonus action, or let it fall on the ground within five feet of them.
 * Or, if both characters are acting on the same initiative, they may both spend bonus actions to throw and receive items.
The thrown item may be caught only by the targeted team member. Enemies may not intercept this item, but they may still pick it up from the ground or take it from the recipient's hands after the pass is made. Picking up an item that was allowed to fall to the ground costs a bonus action.

## Speedy Translation:
When a member of your team translates for the party, they do so quickly, and team members understand the translation instantly. Any language spoken by one present member of the party is effectively spoken by all members. This does not give members the ability to read unknown languages. In order to take this feat, all team members must share a common language. ((Underpowered? Already used in your game? Ideas to make it competitive?))

## Secret Language:
Your team have developed a secret language that only they know. Any who intercept your language must as an action make an intelligence check of DC 17 to interpret the message. After doing so, they can understand your secret language for the next 24 hours.
Choose one of 3 options:

 * Spoken: your language is spoken. It can uniquely be communicated through messanging spells that allow you to send spoken languages. However, the secret language will not have a written or signed version.

 * Written: your language is a written cipher. It can uniquely be passed by messengers or inscribed on objects. However, the cipher will not have a verbal or signed version.

 * Signed: your language is comprised of hand signals. It can uniquely be communicated quickly and silently to any who share line of sight with you. However, the signed language will not have a written or signed version.

You may take this feat multiple times. Upon taking this feat a second time, you unlock a new version of your secret language.

## Empathic Communication:
Knowing each other well, your team begins better able to sense the needs of their compatriots. At any time, even when unconscious, one teammate may send a telepathic impulse to her allies. This massage may only convey a mood, such as happiness, sadness, fear or anger. It does not contain any other information whatsoever.
In addition, certain spells that team members cast receive the following benefits:

 * Any ability that allows players to send each other messages of a certain length or less, (such as Animal Messenger), have their word count limits doubled when sending a message exclusively to other teammates.

 * The spell Message now has a duration based on concentration, lasting up to a minute, but only when it is used to communicate with teammates.

## Careful Targeting:
Your team has become adept at avoiding each other with their attacks. When a team member makes an attack or casts a spell that includes an team member in an area of effect, the targeted team member is less likely to suffer the full effect. If an ability produced by one teammate affects another teammate (including when prompted by compulsion,) observe the following optional benefits:
 * There is a save DC involved, the targeted team member gains an advantage on the save.
 * Any attack made against an ally is made at a disadvantage.

## Harrying Assist:
Your team have become even better at assisting each other in battle. When you perform the help action in battle, rather than granting your ally an advantage on their next attack against the target, you may instead inflict a disadvantage on the target against the next saving throw that the ally subjects them to. The beneficiary of this action must be your teammate.

## Busted Flank Manuever (*Adapted from Pathfinder*)
Whenever you make a melee attack and hit your opponent, you can use a bonus action to grant that opponent a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you until the end of your next turn or until your opponent attacks you, whichever happens first. If that opponent attacks you with this bonus, it provokes attacks of opportunity from your allies who have this feat.
