# The Order of Knowledge

An unspoken, not quite secret, order of devoted to gathering, protecting and understanding the universe through the Great Diegesis.

## The Great Diegesis
At the center of everything is ***The Great Diegesis***. It is a tenant that all things are connected by a single narrative that runs through all the worlds. The goal of the order is to record the elements of the Diegesis.

### Lore
The Great Diegesis (*sometimes just The Diegesis*) is the story of the universe. It has a finite beginning and stretches out from that point in space-time in infinite directions. Each person, every life tells a story that is interconnected with all life in the universe. The most sacred part of any life (or story) is how it is connected to others and to the Diegesis.

The belief is that The Diegesis began as a single idea and that idea is still at the core of the Diegesis, as it extends throughout all of existence. It is believed that all stories either begin or converge at some point along the Diegesis. It is said that great tales can even, for the smallest of moments change the course of the Diegesis or are like large branches from the trunk of the story. While other stories are small offshoots from either these large branches or are smaller branches off the trunk.

The purpose of the order is to find how each story connects to the Great Diegesis.

### Form of the Order
There are six *open* and three *unwritten* ("secret") monasteries. Each monastery has a *privileged library* where the Books of the monastery are kept. Each open monastery keeps  the 166 tomes of the Great Diegesis and the Books of their own brethren. Each monastery also transcribes the Books from their order and sends a copy to each of the *unwritten* libraries.

The *open* monasteries are sometimes concealed in complicit temples or may be thought to be servants of some other order. While the Order of Knowledge is *not exactly* secret they do their best to keep their identity and purpose from the general populace. Traditionally, adepts who record and connect come from one of the *open* monasteries. 

Kept in greater secret, even if they are hiding in plain sight, the *unwritten* monasteries are not only where the great libraries are stored, they are where the exploration into the vast spheres of magic, science etc. are tested and re-tested. The *unwritten* monasteries are heavily guarded.

## Recording
At the core of the Order is the mission to collect information, to learn whatever can be learned. To learn about places, things, people and the way the world works. 

To serve this mission the order trains adepts (*monks*) to go out into the world and learn, record and to connect the story to the Great Diegesis. These agents can be of any walk of life, but tend to the more mundane or scholarly. However they are all still trained in some martial form, in case they are ever required to defend themselves, the Diegesis or the order. Not all of them are trained in combat arts, some are trained in alchemy (poisons) or even magic.

An adept journals constantly. Never assuming that anyone's story or the story of any thing is too small to be chronicled. The best measure of an adept is how well he can connect the stories he uncovers to the Singular Story of the Diegesis. A journals is as much written word as it is often filled with diagrams and sketches. 

The best adepts can tell not only the stories that they encounter, but know the stories that have come before - where they are and from as many chapters in the Diegesis as possible. It is in this way that they can find the connection between seemingly unrelated stories and weave their way back to the Diegesis.

The adept's journals are their prized possessions. They will often scribe copies to be sent back to their order every few years, to ensure that their knowledge is not lost. Still, they tend to keep their original journals to reference back to and to re-visit as they learn new parts of the story.

At the end of their lives, if they retire, they become a *master* and write their Book. The first adept ***Sena***, a gnome, was said to have traveled the world for almost two hundred years. When she retired she compiled her 43 journals into 16 tomes and these became known as *The Book of Sena*. It is the goal of any adept to assemble their own Book.

If an adept dies or is killed, the order considers it a sacred task to recover the adept's journals and complete the work. Because this is always a possibility, an adept's book is frequently full of conjecture of how a story might connect or where they might look for other pieces.

## Exploring Connections
The fusion with the Great Diegesis is the most important part of any story. In that regard it is with this connection in mind that all stories are concluded. Sadly, the great majority of stories are concluded unconnected, and it is these loose ends that adepts work tirelessly to connect to other pieces to other people or things.

The connections that the order seek can come in any form. While some adepts are typically trained in specific fields, every adept is expected to be able to be able to write intelligently about any of the precepts that they may come into contact with. It is also assumed ("*great connection*" ahem) that often many of these precepts will overlap.

### The main precepts
* **People**: Most adepts spend their lives learning about people in the world and not just "important" people, but any people. Because everyone is connected to the Great Diegesis and because a thing may not look like something now, doesn't mean that it won't be something later. Connections between people can be ancestral or through contact or shared people that they knew; shared knowledge that they studied, or even shared lore.

* **Places**: Adepts will also chronicle details or histories about the places that they encounter. Places and their histories set the background, the stage for the Diegesis. Of course, this often includes how modern (or recently modern) people interact or influence the nature or interpretation of the location.

* **Things**: Notable artifacts, both magical and mundane are documented by adepts. Some adepts are more skilled at this analysis than others. For example, there have been dozens of gnome adepts who have written vast catalogs of the engineering-level diagrams of equipment or tools. And of course how they function like or resemble other machines or stories, their connection to the Diegesis.

* **Spheres of Knowledge**
    * Magic
    * Science
    * Nature
    * Religion
    * Lore
    * Interplanar
Some adepts specialize in the testing of various spheres. For example an adept may become a person who tests scientific inquiries or studies magic. While all over the world these are common scholarships, these adepts will often push boundaries or seek to challenge the nature of these spheres, seeking to better understand how they are connected to one another and hence to the Great Diegesis.

One of an adept's most valuable skills is being able to recognize the interest in a thing. Often times to see what is, or might be, special about a thing or person or how it may connect to another precept.

## Roleplaying

Player characters who are part of the order are typically going to be monks or bards, but can be of any class. What they do for the order is their driving force, but may not be something that any one else ever knows that they are doing.

Typically characters of the order will be ***lawful*** and/or ***neutral***

### Some character concepts
A half-elf monk who has honed his skill with his martial weapons to point that he can pass as a weapon master and has served as a lieutenant in the *palace guard* of an influential crimelord. His journal is filled with details about the crimelord, the local authorities that he has dealing with, the captain of the guard, and a tiefling artificer of particular note.

A human artificer who spent 10 years studying and working at one of the *unwritten* monasteries and now serves in an *open* monastery. His training is in both magic and science, which allow him to better investigate and test the stories of the strange items that are brought to him. His hobby, as is such the way with many artificers in the order, is to challenge the Diegesis by creating new or augmenting old things: pushing the barriers and sometimes ***connecting*** the spheres of science and magic.

A dragonborn adventurer (monk) who spent his life searching the world for arcane items to bring back to the order to study. Some of the treasure that he recovered had significant historical value and his recount of their finding was invaluable to piecing together fragments of some other story. Some powerful magic to be inspected by the artificers and mages.
