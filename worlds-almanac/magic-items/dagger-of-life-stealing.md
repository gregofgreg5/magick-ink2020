# Dagger of Life Stealing
*Wonderous item weapon, rare*
___

*A blade made of dark lustrous metal and sporting a number of unsettling skull symbols on the cross-guard, rain guard and pommel.*
___

You gain a **+2 bonus to attack and damage** rolls made with this magic weapon.
___

The dagger has **1d8 + 1 charges**. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has *fewer than 100 hit points*, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The dagger loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the dagger has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
