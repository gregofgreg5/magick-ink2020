# The Oathbreakers

Though the numbers in the group at any given time are variable, The Dragonborn has assembled a group of bounty hunters to aid in his work and his personal quest. Below are the people who comprise the core of the team.

## The Dragonborn

## The Changeling

They work for The Oathbreakers' patron, not The Dragonborn. If the patron commanded, The Changeling would betray The Dragonborn without hesitation. But for now, everyone's goals are aligned and their uneasy alliance holds.

## The Sorceress

Most children go through a phase where they love dragons - pretending to be one, playing with toy serpents, drawing them on everything. The Sorceress never grew out of her obsession and, in fact, it only deepened as she grew. When her magical powers began to manifest she took it as a sign that she had been touched by the power of a dragon, then that she had actual draconic blood within her, and now she believes that she is the one true (adopted) daughter of Tiamat. Born closer to the gutter than the castle, she nevertheless adopted a noble's attitude during her time being schooled in magic. Not many know where she comes from and she never says other than that she was raised by sorcerers until is was obvious that she had surpassed them.

As she casts spells, the glowing shape of a dragon head appears around her, the color aligned with the type of dragon that would have similar power (red for fire, green for poison, blue for lightning, etc.). Whether this is a sign that that she is actually favored by Tiamat or if it's simply due to her fanatical belief in it is up to debate. She has an enormous tattoo of Tiamat that covers most of her back and spreads onto her arms, buttocks, and legs. Her hair is red with streaks of white, black, blue, and green. She wears what is commonly known as "bikini armor" - scale mail that covers little skin yet somehow still provides protection. The armor is multicolored like her hair.

Her relationship with The Dragonborn is complicated. Some days she disdains him for not being an actual dragon or being of limited potential due to only being one color. She believes her lineage makes her superior to him (and everyone, for that matter) and is only part of the group to prove it and to further Tiamat's influence in the world. Other times she's so overtly attracted to him it makes the other team members uncomfortable. All are 100% certain that they have had conjugal visits.

## The Hunter

One of the ways the Slaad of the Lower Planes reproduce is by infecting others with The Phage, a disease that completely tranforms the infected into a frog-like Slaad. Years ago a fervent young acolyte became infected with the phage and was rushed to his temple to try and combat the transformation. Unfortunately, the other priests were not as skilled as they should have been or believed they were. What resulted was a weeks-long battle between the devoted will of the acolyte and the relentless change of the demonic infection. In the end, the boy's body was transformed into a green Slaad and his mind became a jumbled mess. The devotion to his god of light turned into a devotion to a god of death. The oath to bring healing became an oath to seek out those that needed to die.

Ejected from the temple after killing a few priests, he roamed the forests and wild lands on the fringes of civilization learning to hunt people that the whispers in his head told him must be killed. He discovered an affinity for swarms of insects (that were also a large part of his diet) and a cloud of magical Murder Hornets became his to command, constantly buzzing around him, his spells manifesting them as part of their effect. It was there that he was found by The Dragonborn, who also believes that there are some people who simply need to die. Since then The Hunter has followed The Dragonborn in all his pursuits, believing the knight is an unknowing agent of the death god and delighting in the hunts, torture, and death they engage in together.
