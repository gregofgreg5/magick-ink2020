## The End of a Really Bad Week
**23 Nightal 1492**

It had already been a complicated week that started with a Xantharian firebombing in the tavern and included half of the adventurers being sent on a mission to the **Mere of Dead Men**. The journey to the Mere alone promised to be at at least twenty days. As if that weren't enough, the party gathered this morning to find that one of their own, Mon-K'ee, had left. Leaving behind **osprey, the Sinister knife** and **the Sinister ring** for Borl. While discussing Mon-K'ee's departure, Borl discovered another package. This one wrapped and hidden underneath a bench, which he quickly passed off to Barakka to inspect.

Inside was a small wooden box with no marking or latches. When Barakka opened it, a brilliant light and smoke filled the room. The whispy forms of green, winged-snakes swirled in the smoke. Suddenly, two hulking figures materialized in the center of the room: ogres! During the pitched battle with the monsters, **Ursula**, an armored polar bear standing over seven feet tall arrived to lend a paw. Jarik's new *shield guardian* blasted into the fight and almost single-handedly dispatched one of the ogres. However, before the second ogre could be dealt with a thurnderous explosion rocked Trollskull Alley. A bright light, from the tavern windows burst into the room as the whole street shook.

A bright light and blistering heat could be felt through the front doors and windows. They quickly finished off the last ogre and the whole team (what's left of it) and Emmett, who had arrived to  assist in the battle, rushed outside to aid the injured and determine the cause of the destruction. There were dozens of injured people milling about and eleven fatalities: an unfamiliar elderly human woman out for a walk; three servants from the wealthy North Ward: two human females and a male half-elf who had been on the Alley running errands; a male gnome wearing a fine outfit covered by a burnt cloak, grasping a dagger; two cloaked and armored sellswoards, with their swords still bound into their scabbards and Falrin & Casita Softsong and Joyius & Quiola Fazzanch, the four halfling minstrels who had spent so many hours at the Tavern lately.  

Devistated by the deaths of their friends, the adventurers pressed on, investigating the scene and interviewing witnesses. Jarik disovered a small parchment tucked in the pocket of the gnome, with "Trollskull Manor" and their address scrawled upon it. Luzieros did his best to find some way to save souls for Talos. After hearing that a third sellsword had taken something from the gnome and made good his escaped down the Alley towards the Bent Nail, Barakka chased through the gathering crowd after him. Meanwhile, Borl inspected and removed one of the the buttons securing one of the sellswords' weapons: a small metal button painted black with the image of a winged serpent. A stranger on the Alley, Ursula did her (remember, giant polar bear) best to help calm the crowd while keeping a close eye on Jarik. Emmett found young **Martem Trec**, a 12-year old halfling, a freind to both the minstrels and tavern keepers. Martem had been hiding behind some water barrels near the Alley, clutching something to his chest. The boy had been hiding behind the barrel when he heard something drop into it. Curious, he fished out a chain with five small orbs, that seemed almost animated by a small fire inside of each one. *A necklace of fireballs*. **Iefyr Qifaren**, a female elf, had been down to *Bookworm’s Treasure* doing some local research, she saw the three sellswords chasing the gnome and shouting at him. She couldn't be sure, but she thought they were headed towards Trollskull Manor.

Noticing the aerial member of the **Griffon Calvary**, one of Waterdeep's defenders, circling over head, the team knew time was running short. The City Guard under the command of **Civilar Girogi Blackspear** arrived en masse, while two represenatives from the City Watch: **Sargent Saeth Cromley** and **Captain Guryon** also make the scene, with **Barnibus Blastwind**, from *Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors*, in their company. It wasn't long before the adventurers/tavern keepers were the center of attention. Barakka arrived, empty-handed, as the Civilar Blackspear was urging the Watch to place the team in custody. He had already begun to insist that the party surrender their *unautorized* weapons. Guryoon and Barakka conferred they all agreed that the rest of this conversation best held inside. The Civilar Blackspear, a couple of the Guard and the Watch contingent followed the team into the tavern while the rest of the Guard surrounded the building. *We're all friends here, until we're not*.

Inside, they were surprised to find the two ogres arranged and the rest of the tavern more or less put back together: the work of Hannah, Jake and Lif. The fire bombs, the ogres and now a fireball outside their doorstep, the Civilar Blackspear was more and more convinced that if the party wasn't a involved, they were a magnet for trouble and needed to be kept in safer confines. Sargeant Cromley was beginning to agree. Barakka, Jarik and Luzieros argued their case as victims, making no recognition of the continued requests to surrender their weapons. Finally, Guryon, reminded the rest of the City authorities, that these were the folk responsible for taking down that Zhent crew on the docks a few weeks ago and after that they had overturned one of the Xanathar's dens, killing three prominent Xanthar lieutenants in the process. Civilar Blackspear continued to argue thse facts made them more of a danger to civilians, pointing at recent acts as evidence. Finally, Barnibus weighed in on the side of the party, citing that while they may be dangerous and a danger to be to close to, that they were making the correct enemies and that perhaps the city should be doing more to assist them, rather than arrest them. As tensions were clearly starting to ease, Ursula and Emmett *went to the kitchen get get refreshments* and confirm that they were surrounded. While the Guards standing post were visibily discomforted by Borl's presence.

Having won that battle, Jarik and Luzerios made the argument that they should be allowed to help interview and investigate the crime scene, being more familiar with the neighborhood. While pretty much everyone else disagreed, again Barnibus supported their argument and Guryon fell in line. While investigating the carnage, the party learned that the gnome had been identified as **Dalakhar**, an confidant of the former Open Lord Dagult Neverember. A clear connection to the on-going *Dragon* nonsense was drawn and the members of the Guard and the Watch grew even more concerned. 

After the rest of the City's contingent departed, Captain Guryon remained behind. He explained, that while honorable and noble, Barakka's request that the halfling's bodies be remanded into their custody would be denied and that a proper next of kin could claim them, through official channels. He tells you that while he, and some key others, are mostly comfortable with you guys, just about everyone thinks that at least *some of you are off-putting*. And you are new to Waterdeep and as much as many people seem to like you (him included) there’s a deep-running local-bias that runs through Waterdeep. He also shares with them that the man whom Fala saw, and Barakka chased, matches the description of **Urstul Floxin**, a suspected member of the Black Network. 

He continues that something is stirring in the *Zhentarim*. They have always had a presence in Waterdeep, but they have mostly been splintered and fragmented. But lately, there seem to be more of them and they seem more aggressive, *gesturing around at the ogres*. *The Xanathar*, who have always been a nuisance, have also taken a much more forceful response. *He’s not saying that they tolerate the Xanathar*, but, this is next level. There is speculation (*remember that Guryon is pretty well connected*) that both sides have been importing talent and while the Xanathar have had a foothold in this region for a long time, the Zhentarim have a much larger, global network. And they have put a bounty on you guys. Barakka asked if the Black Network had any connection to the black ship in the harbor, Guryon, quickly denied any knowledge or association with that ship saying that whatever, whoever they are, they do their best to stay out of trouble in Waterdeep and we let them. *He does suggest that if you wanted more information about that ship, you should ask your **friends** at the Office of the Harbor Master*.

Shortly after Guryon leaves, almost as if they had been waiting for just such an opportunity, **Victor Trench**, the local priviate detective, and a handseome woman, a Waterdavian, clearly born of wealth and privilege arrive. Trench has brought his client in to tell them what she saw: *"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It had been on the roof, where it's cape blowing in the wind caught my eye. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"* She doesn't know what the "puppet" hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn't know where it went.

After a brief discussion, the "marionette" is similar to the automotons that march in the [**Day of Wonders** parade](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Day_of_Wonders). The most likely place to find one of these is the [***House of the Inspired Hands***](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Inspired_Hands#Inhabitants).

Not surprisingly, Trench would not tell them why his client was there and assured them that, that was all she knew. After she left, he also told them what he had turned up in his investigations on their behalf. *"The Xanathar are buzzing around like you've kicked their hornets nest. They are pissed and want retribution for their losses. They have also put up a bounty on you,, but it's unclear if they are mustering a genuine direct attack, at this time."*

The Zhents on the other hand are definitely, *well he thinks* are more likely, to keep coming at you and escalating their attacks. The Zhentarim, the Black Network, as he's sure you all know, are a vast organization that spreads across Faerun and beyond. But typically, they are more like a smaller, loosely connected factions with varying interests, than some singularly purposed criminal empire. *Not like the old days*. Lately however, there has been a huge *in-flux* of *extra-muscle*, different Zhent factions showing up in Waterdeep. Most notably, a couple of months ago a particularly *dangerous sounding* faction arrived on the Crimson Sail. Noteably, he continues, the tavern-keepers killed one of them, *Jarrack*, when he tried to ambush them in the streets. Trench isn't sure what's going on, but he tells them that the way that the Zhent have operated in Waterdeep has changed of late. Even some of their *more recognized, almost legit social-political connections* have become more reclusive and less available. And among some of the more unscrupulous brigands, *thugs*, there has been an excitement that something is coming soon: like they expect a *big change* and to *be on top* very soon. He doesn't know what to make of it, but there is some kind of *"second coming"* that is being cautiously, but excitedly whispered about.

The party also seeks out an audience with **Renear Neverember**, which isn't difficult, since the noble continues to be very grateful for your timely rescue and even considers (*most of you*) friends. He is happy to tell you all that he knows about Dalakhar. *"That little shit had been left behind to keep an eye on me. *But you really don't want to mess with the Harpers*," he starts to brag, but remembered his company and shruged, "unless said Harper is two sheets to the wind and gets nabbed by a few Zhents..." he shakes his head and continues, "he was small time in my father's operation. He had been watching me, for months, we allowed it figuring the better to know who and what he was seeing, but we finally chased him off about two tendays ago. My father didn't trust many people, but he trusted that gnome."

"After I heard about what happened today, I spoke to a few of Dalakhar's friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve ***the Stone of Golorr*** and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Golorr to my father in Neverwinter."

Barakka, who has hatched a plan with Jarik and Luzeiros, asked Renear for a favor. He told him that *Young Jake Silverado, has a lot of his father's admirable qualities, but was a little too much to handle, as a soldier. He's a good kid, but needs some structure and direction. We were hoping, maybe you could help him get into the Harpers.*

Having gotten to know Emmett, Hannah and Jake around the tavern, Renear is thrilled at the opportunity. Emmett's presence, confidence and competence speaks volumes of the type of soldier he was. He has even befriended Jake a bit and completely understands where Barakka is coming from. He is thrilled to mentor Jake into the Harpers.

*And a plan is launched.*

It is also decided that the fireball necklace should be turned over to the authorities. Jarik tured the necklace over to Barnibus Blastwind at the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors. He explained that one of their staff had acquired it in the scrum and had not reported it to them until after the authorities had left. Grateful for the assistance, Barnibus thanked him and took the beads.

*They did keep one of the fireball beads, which* (to some surprise) *was left in Luzerios' possession.*

The party considered their options.
* Investigate the automoton at House of the Inspired Hands
* See what can be learned at the Office of the Harbor Master, *maybe even begin an investigation into the Crimson Sail*...
... and Luzeiros suggests...
* Why don't we try to go talk to the Zhents

It was decided that Borl will go investigate the House of the Inspired Hands, and may take a few weeks away, investigating *along the docks*. An idea that everyone is pretty okay with. Especially Ursula, *he kinda creeps her out*. And it was decided that the party would reach out to Victor Trench to set up an meeting to discuss an *armistice*.

## Meeting the Zhentarim
**Two days later**

In the afternoon, Victor Trench returned with an invitation to meet with the Zhentarim at midnight. The party agreed and he told them that a representative would come to the Tavern to fetch them.

At midnight, **Davil Starsong** and a cadre of eight swordsmen arrive at Trollskull Manor. Starstrong, has been accorded the title of *Master of Opportunities and Negotiation* in the Zhent's local network for the past five years. He is one of the Zhent features that Trench will tell them has been less visible and self-sure, over the past few months. Regardless, he arrives to take the team to their meeting. Unbeknownst to the adventurers at the time, one of the swordsmen was **Ziraj the Hunter**, one of their most feared assassins.

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/wdh-old-tower.jpg)

The party was taken to ***Old Tower*** which was built hundred of years ago by a mostly-forgetten wizard whose only legacy is thie dilapidated structure. Inside, the tower the ceilings are 15 feet high and The tower is brightly lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces. They are led to the second floor where there are a dozen or so swordsmen, who join Davil, Ziraj and a hooded figure seated at the lone table and chair. As they enter, the figure rises to greet them and they see that is a surprisingly old, frail but nimble human. *A wizard of some kind to experienced eyes*. 

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/manshoon-2020-12-23.jpg)

Without giving them an actual introduction, they learned that the wizard *calls himself **Manshoon*** and he was very deliberate and animated in all of his actions. Each motion was over-exaggerated or repeated over and over for effect. *It's more creepy than annoying that he also refers to himself in the **third person***. There was a genuine sense of menace and danger throughout the room, if not from the guards, from Manshoon himself. Negotiations went back and forth, and the party began to wonder if Manshoon's *deck really has many things*. While no immediate threat is made, *and Luzieros had done the math, a Thunderwave or the fireball bead would be a bad, bad call in these close quarters*.

Their discomfort increased, as a shadowy, hooded figure seemed to materialize behind Manshoon. It moved with graceful, powerful, almost pacing strides. Dangerous yellow eyes peered out from under the hood as it moved around Manshoon, occassionally whispering to him. **Mr. Shadow** ,they learned. And they can finally put a (very disturbing) picture to the enemy who kicked Erethil from the roof during the battle with Jarrack. Mr. Shadow seemed to be as much counsel to Manshoon as he was a menace to the party. Finally, with Mr. Shadow's tacit agreement, the party conceded to what they believe is the "best" offer that they're going to get: **They find the Stone or Dragons, they turn them over to the Zhentarim here, at this tower. If the Zhents find either of those first, the party will have 48 hours before the hunt to kill them begins.**

Jarik, in a drunken state, took a while to remember where he had heard the name *Manshoon* before. He kept thinking it had something to do with the Zhentarim, though he admited that assumption could have been being influenced by their current situation. But there was something, maybe something about "Manshoon" and the beginning of the Zhentarim, but that didn't make sense. The Zhents have been around for over two hundred years...
 

**To be Continued... 1/6/2021**
But before that, [here's what happened in between adventures.](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/story-so-far/dragon-heist%20module/wdh-2020-12-24-between-time.md)

# What happens in between

## *Marshoon, WHO...?*
**Jarik**

Jarik can't shake *this whole Manshoon thing*, aside from being the creepiest thing that he'd ever seen, he can't let go of the connection. He embarked on a litle leg-work, checking at a the Waterdeep library and a couple of local temple's collection of tomes. Careful not to mention or be noticed searching for the wizard, his research confirmed this information:

>**Manshoon** (pronounced: /mɑːnˈʃuːn/ man-SHOON) was one of the original founders of the **Zentharim** or the **Black Network** (1261). Evil to the core, he made enemies all across Faerun, including other powerful spellcasters such as Khelben Arunsun and Elminster. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, Manshoon magically crafted several clones-but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Manshoon Wars. All but three of the clones were destroyed. Two of those met their demise in their own adventures. The third, the last clone of Manshoon, had retreated into the Undermountain, where he had a final, fatal confrontation the rival sorceror Halastar Blackcloak, some time around 1370.

## Writ of Parole

29  Nightal 1492

**Barakka, Luzieros, Jarik and Ursula** had been summmoned to the Office of the Magister. When they arrived they find **Captain Guryon, Sargent  Cromley, Barnibus Blastwind and Guard Aumarr (*Captain*) Shain Ravenhook** and **Civilar (*lieutenant*) Girogi Blackspear** waiting for them in the outer office of the Magister. They were escoted in, weapons and all, to Kylynne Silmerhelve's inner chamber. Silmerhelve, a stately, official-looking mature tiefling woman, wearing the standard black robes of her office bid the adventuers to sit down. She told them that "they have been a very contested topic of conversation around these halls lately. That Waterdeep is a city of tradition and order, where the law is above all else. And, that since you've been here, you all seem to be oblivious to this or *perhaps are being drawn obliviously* into trouble."

She actually paused for effect. *It works*, "There are some," she very purposefully did not make any indications, "who believe that you are trouble magnets or perhaps even instigators, that left to your own devices, that you would have Waterdeep turned head over tail into one of those lawless *pirate islands*. There are others who are quick to point out that you and your friends have done several significant services, including rescuing two respected citizens from the clutches of... *I can't even keep track of that mess...*, and in the processes rendered some very nafarious individuals who have plauged this city of late. It might be said that we already have *big trouble* and that you are more ally than accelerant."

"I believe the commment was that *you are making the right enemies.* Be that as it may, the Lords of Waterdeep have impressed upon this office to recognize both your service in the city, your successful restoration of Trollskull manor - I might add in record time - **and** that your alliance, *such that it is* has also undertaken a significant boon on behalf of the Lords, travelling to the Mere of Deadmen."

"It has therefore been ordered that you be given **a Writ of Parole** which will give you the right to carry arms in the City of Waterdeep, for the expressed purposes of self-defense and to defend other Waterdavians in imminent danger. This writ does not bestow any martial or municipal powers and you are still subject to the laws of our land, with the caveat of the aforementioned **duties**. It has been requested that it be specified that you, as are all who are within our City limits, are forbidden from accosting, harassing or assualting *anyone*. But it is not this Office's intention to render you helpless, when it is clear that you have demonstrated yourselves a great *help* to us already."

And with that Guryon produced **four** official writs and handed out one to each of you. The gathered officers offer you *congratulations, of sorts*, and you are turned out into the street without any further ado.

## Softsong & Fazzanachs

Following the death of their parents in the fireball incident Sanamin and her brother Ordin Softsong, and Xanyas Fazzanch have taken up living and working in Trollskull Manor. Sanmina and Xanyas had already reached their majority, by recognized halfling standards, Ordin is only a few years behind. The three of them had already been working in the Manor and it was easy for Hannah and company to make extra space for them to live.

Sanamin and Ordin spend most of their time working: cleaning or cooking with Hannah. They seem to be focused on working their way through their grief. It is easy to see that both are still clearly devastated by their loss, but they appreciate the good-natured camaraderie in the tavern. Xanayas is a different story, he seems to be becoming more and more sullen with each passing day. His good nature and pleasant smile still fill any room he walks into, but beneath that thin veneer there is a palpable sadness. There have been times when he has even been *short* or snapped at someone, when he almost seems morose. Very uncharacteristic for the young halfling. He also seems to miss Borl. *There’s one in every crowd*.

## The Arrival of Peyton Song of Tyr

01 Hammer 1493

Fresh on the morn, the spectacle of a lavish, albeit short, priest and his retinue arrive at Trollskull Manor in search of Barakka. The priest introduces himself as “Peyton Song of Tyr, of the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter”, he seemed very proud of coming from the grand temple in Neverwinter. Peyton, an old *friend* of Barakka, has come to deliver a special gift, bestowed upon him by right and his personal honor. He invites everyone to a ceremony in morning in which he will bestow the might weapon ***MorningBlade*** upon Barakka.

Barakka seems both irked and happy to see the diminutive priest, who had once been both his chaperone and mentor. However, Barakka is quite elated to learn that MourningBlade would finally be passed to his hands.

After Peyton and his entourage leave, Barakka explains that MourningBlade was created by the High Mage Alustriel Silverhand, when she was the ruler of Silverymoon, for his great, great great, great grandfather Thorn Shieldstrong. Thorn had been a great warrior, champion in the Orc-Troll War in 1276. The sword has been passed, through a ritual process (*he actually rolled his eyes*), to the greatest warrior of his family. It was last weilded by his father’s father, Ord, over fifty years ago. It is easy to sense that Barakka sees this as a great honor, and equally that he believes that he should have had it before now.

Those who wish to, can attend the ceremony for Barakka at the Hall of Justice (Tyr’s temple here in Waterdeep has the same name as the one in Neverwinter). The ceremony is long and as much about Peyton Song of Tyr as it is about Barakka. In the ceremony it is also revealed that his name is actually **Leonard Shieldstrong**, a surprise to most of you. Even more surprising. Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep was chief of among the attendees at the ceremony. She seemed very familiar with Petyon and everyone was shocked when she greeted Barakka cordially, even friendlily!

And as it turns out, Peyton has accepted a position at the Waterdeep Hall of Justice and promises that he will frequently stop by the tavern to check in on Barakka!

## The Adventure Continues

Six days have passed since the clandestine agreement between the tavernlords and Marshoon. While busy investigating, few leads have turned up. Most discouraging, there has been absolutely no word on the whereabout of Urstel Floxin, the Zhent assassin seen fleeing Trollskull Alley the day of the fireball. It is also becoming clear that whatever Borl is up to, it is unlikely that any information from him will arrive in a timely manner. *Perhaps the team wants to investigate the House of Inspired Hands as well*…

Here are some of the main options to consider next:
* Investigate the automaton at House of the Inspired Hand

* While previous inquiries to the Office of the Harbor Master have been, interesting, but not particularly useful, today Chella came by and let the team know that there is gossip from the crew of the *Eyecatcher*, that they have one of the keys and believe that they are close to acquiring the Stone!  

Or…?

# Campaign Notes (January 6, 2021)

## The House of Inspired Hands

**02 Hammer 1493**

Borl returned just as the team was about to head to the docks to investigate the lead from the Office of the Harbor Master. He informed them that there is indeed at least one more of these *marionette's* at ***The House of Inspired Hands***.

The House of Inspired Hands is a temple of [Gond, the  Lord of All Smiths pushed for innovation and imaginativeness](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gond). At the House adepts and clerics alike followed Gond's precept of creation and innovation. The temple is made up of four main buildings, most of which are interconnected and surrounded on all sides by a courtyard full of trees and places to study or create. There is an eleven-foot wall that surrounds the entire property. Few Waterdavians venture into the House, unless to see the wonderous treasures that the followers have created.

The team was greeted by *Bari*, an elderly gnome woman, who recognized Borl from his earlier visits. The team tell Bari that they would like to talk to someone about the marionette. A bit sheepishly, she recognizes the description immediately and calls it a *nimblewright*. She told them that it was a gift to the temple about 20 years ago. She offered to fetch one of the priests, Lady Valetta, who would be able to tell them more. She invited them to look around the courtyard while she fetched the priest.

While they were waiting, they noticed the mario... nimblewright on the roof of the nearest building, watching them. Before they could react the nimblewright thew a mechanical bird at them. It flew with amazing speed and accuracy. Like a dart it crashed into Luzeiros. The mech bird, bounced off the large firbolg and flew, at little worse for its effort, back towards the roof, where the nimblewright had disappeared.

With the grace of Talos guiding his patience, Luzeiros waited until the bird was just about to the roofline and then fired off a [**shatter spell**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shatter). A thunderous sound exploded through the compound as the poor defenseless wooden trinket was blasted to oblivion, along with a good portion of the roof. As the dust settled, the shadow of the nimblewright popped up and then ducked behind what was left of the room and disappeared behind the building.

Just then Lady Valetta, priest of Gond showed up, waving her hands in front of Luzeiros and the others. Valetta was a fierce looking gold dragon, a small wisp of smoke flowing from her nose. Bari chased behind her, struggling to keep up to Lady Valetta's stride.

Valetta recognized the Tavernlords at once and was happy to show them to the nimblewright. As she led them through the temple, they saw some of the wonders. 

* A 4 -foot-tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood. iron. bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold.
* A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it
* becomes airborne.
* A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle miniature submersible has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 1363 DR." **Ursula found the submersible fascinating. Turns out that the submersible was real and really did sink.**
* A functional "waking helmet" equipped with small, articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep.
* A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "The Scarlet Marpenoth. Lantanese submersible. Launched in 1489 DR." **Like *Big Belchy*, *the Scarlet Marpenoth* is real, it was launched and has changed hands several times. The temple doesn't exactly know who owns it now.**

## Nim's Lair

![image](https://github.com/gregofgreg5/magick-ink2020/blob/main/images/nimblewright.jpg)
Nim, (a nimblewright)

Valetta and Bari led the Tavernlords to Nim's living area, which was described as the attic version of Harry Potter's under-the-stairs closet. When the arrived at the door they found a lock that neither Vaeletta nor Bari had ever seen before. Valetta told the team to wait here, while she went to retrieve an adept to open it. She absolutely forbade them breaking the door down, with the warning delivered specifically to Luzeiros. Instead, Jarik picked the lock which turned out to be a lot less formidable than it had appeared.

Inside, Nim's room was a lot larger than Harry's. It was filled with detritus and junk of all kinds. They immediately saw the tall, spindly looking wooden nimblewright duck behind some a table. In the junk they saw broken parts of just about anything that you might find around the temple. And dozens of things that were clearly half created. Some bizarre works in progress, like what appeared to be a wooden arm.

They learned that Nim was sentient, seemingly intelligent. While it understood common, it was unable to communicate other than through a limited sign language that the temple had developed. They quickly began to feel sorry for the nimblewright. While it couldn't talk, Borl was able to [*Detect Thoughts* ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts), which allowed him to understand the creature, to a point. 

It turned out that Nim had created a second nimblewright, broken and *less smart* than Nim, it was created so that Nim would have a friend. When asked if it was the other nimblewright who fireballed the Alley, Nim thought it was possible. It came and went as it pleased. Often getting into mischief, requiring Nim to go out and drag its pieces back to the temple to re-assemble them. When asked how it found the broken nimblewright, Nim gestured at the nimblewright detector that Valetta had been beating him with.

the nimblewright detector

Tempers began to rise as Valetta grew angrier and angrier with Nim, it became clear that they would have to do something to save it. There was clearly no reasoning with Valetta, Jarik unleashed his fey presence, intimidating her, and company *insist/request* that Nim help lead them to the missing nimblewright.

At first it seemed as if Valetta would reist, but in the end she dismissed them with a *"Just make sure to bring..."* seeing something that she didn't quite like, a trouble she didn't want to cross (right now), *"just go."*

## *The Eyecatcher*

To no one's surprise, Nim led the Tavernlords to the dock ward The nimblewright detector led the party to ***The Eyecatcher*** at about twilight. The most extravagant, ostentatious even ship on the docks, the *Eyecatcher* stood out against the gray winter background of the harbor. Borl's information on ***The Sea Maidens Faire*** was that the *traveling circus* is made up of three ships: *Eyecatcher*, *Hearbreaker* and *Hellraiser*. *Eyecatcher* was the carnival's flagship, while the other two transported more of the business of the show.

This evening, it looked liked activity was at a lull. There were a few deckhands on the ship, more milling about than being busy. After a brief *introduction* the party boarded and told them that they were looking for nimblewrights. One of the men went down and brought back their captain **Zardoz Zord** and a small contingent of his men back to the deck.

Despite his best efforts to invite the Tavernlords to his cabin to discuss the matter, a battle broke out.  However before the first blow was struck, ***Talos struck*** and a bolt of lightning struck the ship, disabling the vessel's *disguise spell*, revealing that the crew (except for Zord) were actually drow! 

Faced with Zord, three drow gunslingers, and two elite warriors, the team battled. Nim was sent to try to find the missing nimblewright.

# Campaign Notes (January 20, 2021)

## Drow pirates, a wet polar bear and violence or *This is why we can't have nice things*

The battle raged on. With most of his crew out on *one last night on the town* before *Eyecatcher* sets sail for Neverwinter, Zord decided that it would be best to retreat for reinforcements. *After all, how much damage could these vagabonds do?*

The three gunfighters and two elite warriors were more than a handful. Barakka summoned his aura, emboldening his comrades. Borl dealt one of the warriors a [***Mind Spike***](http://dnd5ed.wikidot.com/spell:mind-spike) on his way to find Nim. While Jarik made the most of the Sinister knife, *viper*, even if he had to keep going to pick it up. *Maybe he needs a knife-retrieving weasel or something*... Still, Luzeiros' [***fog cloud***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fog-cloud) hampered both sides until he unleashed *the mighty thunderwave*!

![](https://i.imgur.com/AcXlPiC.png)

The thunderwave was devastating, as usual, but this time no friendlies were caught in the blast and unfortunately none of the villains were taken down in the concussion. It was *Eyecatcher* that took the brunt of the damage. Luzieros smashed through a hole through the deck and smashed the base of the mast, dropping it on to the deck. Luzeiros nimbly (*you know for a guy his size*) avoided falling into the crater that he had created. And while the damage to the deck didn't seem significant at the time, we'll check back on that again later.

With the fog cloud dispersed, Ursulsa, Jarik and Barakka finally brought the warriors down. The gunsfighters were another story. Seeing the obvious danger, two of them turned their fire on Luzieros. The big lug was dropped in a barrage of gunfire. Jarik unleashed [***Chill Touch***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chill-touch) to no avail. Barakka *lay hands* Luzeiros, reviving him, and he promptly jumped right back into the fray. Ursula dispatched one of the gunfighters and Barakka finished the last of them.

### Below decks

With the danger abated, the party found Borl and Nim below deck where they were looking over some broken parts from Nim's creation. Let's call the creation, ***Min***. From the marks on the floor and it looked like Min had been severely beaten in this location. Nim's detector was spinning out of control, pointing towards the deck below, although he was too distracted by the pieces of his companion.

Ursula and Jarik investigated the rest of the hold and found it fully loaded, ready to travel.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XlNhzjW.jpg)

The detector lead to Zord's locked cabin. As soon as Jarik picked the lock a [***Magic Mouth***](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth) opened on the door and hollered *"By Lolth's teeth, have you no manners?"* Obviously some kind of alarm. Undeterred, the Tavernlords entered the room and stood shocked.

They found a lavish, decadent cabin with expensive-looking purple and pink lace draperies, tapestries and blankets adorning the room. In the center of the room stood a third nimblewright with a wooden rapier pointing at them and at its feet, the rest of the the broken Min.

Jarik channeled his *fey presence* and lulled the nimblewright with his charms. While he relaxed the construct, the rest of the team looked through the cabin. Their search came to an abrupt stop when the nimblewright held out a small, palm-sized green stone for Jarik. **The Stone of Golorr**!!

![](https://i.imgur.com/P4LMZ6M.jpg)

A huge relief and a new tension filled the room. The entire underworld of Waterdeep has been looking for this thing and now they have found it. On the other hand, the entire underworld of Waterdeep has been looking for this thing and now they have found it! Jarik dropped it securely into his back-up travel mug.

The team was about to decide to head back to the dock, when all of a sudden a green light filled the room. Everything drifted from purple to a light jade, glowing green. Paralyzed, all they could do is watch as the vision unfolded. Unclear even which parts were real and which were vision.

>**The vision**
>The party sees the stone hovering above them. It moves through the walls and ceilings of the ship. A halo-like glow rings the edge of the vision as the stone moves through the ship.
>
>Finally it moves quickly skyward, through the ship, hovering over 20 feet above the vessel. Suddenly, almost violently, it takes off, flying towards the horizon. It darts and dodges, finally coming to a stop in midair, then abruptly shoots down into the water.
>
>Like an arrow it dives for what seems like a long time until it nears the seafloor, spinning away from the collision at the last possible instant.
>Darting along, rising and cruising, spinning, the stone soared through the ocean. Again, with a sudden, neck-breaking turn it shot up towards the surface. However instead of breaking the plane of the water, it spun into a cavernous passage, emerging in a large underwater cave... full of gold.

"What we need is a submarine..." Luzeiros muttered. The party began planning, *head back*, *what about Marshoon, did he see that?*

The Other pulled on Luzeiros' arm and led him to a secret hatch in the room. The hatch led to a small, cramped room with another hatch on the floor. Luzeiros, Jarik and Borl jumped into the room. The big firbolg opened the hatch revealing the inside of a submarine! ***The Scarlet Marpenoth***!

Ursula is quick to point out that this was the ship that they had seen a model of back at the House of Inspired Hands. An actual freaking submarine.

The Tavernlords, already drunk with the idea that they could *commandeer* a submarine came across five rock gnomes, who were surprised to see them, but didn't really seem like they were oppositional. Seeing an opportunity, Barakka flexed his noble might and bribed them into submission. A 50 gp prize, per day was an outstanding bid and quickly snapped up. The party scrounged together all the monies that they had to pay the gnomes retainer.

A quick search of the ship, turned up four drow sailors who surrendered without a fuss. They were in no way prepared to confront a giant polar bear and a firbolg. Or the rest of them. 

After a brief discussion, Ursula swam to the  submarine hatch at the bottom of the *Eyecatcher*. Mammoth paws turned the valve, opening the lower chamber. As the water filled the small room, she floated gracefully to the inner hatch and tore that free, beginning the scuttling of the beautiful ship.

The polar bear swam out to the Scarlet Marpenoth and having retrieved it's frosty and wet saboteur, the vessel dove beneath the surface. Behind them, the breached the hull and deck began to splinter and then suddenly the deck in Zord's cabin burst and was flooded. Slowly *Eyecatcher* began to list gently to port as the Tavernlords, two (and a half) nimblewrights, five rock gnomes and a purloined submarine made for deep water.

Did **Manshoon** (or anyone) else see the vision above the ship? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*was there actually anything to see...?*

Where did **Zardoz Zord** go and won't he be surprised when he gets back?

Can they trust these rock gnomes? 

Will they actually make it to Neverember's pilfered loot?

All* this and more will be answered next time:

**February 3, 2021.**
