# Firebrand Mace
*Wonderous item weapon, rare*
___

*A highly stylized mace carved out of a metal that looks like it is cast of some bronze-like metal, with fire-like carvings in th weapon.Cast in cold steel, this shortbow is plain and inornate. It feels lighter than an it should.*
___

Use a bonus action to speak this mace's command word, causing flames to erupt from the head of the mace. *These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet.* While the mace is ablaze, it deals an **extra 2d6 fire damage** to any target it hits. The flames last until the weilder uses a bonus action to speak the command word again or until the weapon is dropped, released or sheathed.

The mace has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a target no more than one size larger than you with the mace, you can expend up to 3 of its charges as part of the attack. When you do, **the target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is launched 10 feet away from you for each expended charge**. If the target hits a solid object by being launched in this way, it takes **1d6 bludgeoning damage** for every 10 feet it had left to travel from the impact. If the solid object is a creature, that creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage from the impact as the target of the attack.
