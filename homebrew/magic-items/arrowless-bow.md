# Arrowless Bow
*Wonderous item weapon, rare*
___

*Cast in cold steel, this shortbow is plain and inornate. It feels lighter than an it should.*


**Arrowless bow**. Release the empty string, and an inanimate object nearby will fling itself in the direction you aimed, as if a **[catapult spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/catapult)** were cast. Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isnâ€™t being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

If the weider is proficient with the weapon and fifth level, the maximum weight of objects that be can targeted with this spell increases to 10 pounds, and the damage increases to 4d8. At eighth level, the spell maximum weight increases by 15 pounds and danage increases to 5d8.
