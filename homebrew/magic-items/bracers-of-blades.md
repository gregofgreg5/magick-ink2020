# Bracers of blades
*Wonderous item weapon, rare*
___

*These ornate armbands are made of the finest leather.*
___

These leather armband appears to have thin daggers etched to them. As an action, the wearer can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don't hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.

The bracer can also be used to store up to four other daggers. Upon command, with one bonus action, the wearer can summon up to two specific daggers to an empty hand.
